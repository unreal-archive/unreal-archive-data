Jailbreak is a gametype modification: it adds a new gametype, "Jailbreak", that sits alongside DeathMatch, Capture the Flag, Domination and
so on. It introduces new rules and new effects, and maps specific to the gametype.

### Gameplay

In Jailbreak, like in many other game types, your objective is to frag the opposing players — but unlike other game types, fragged players
go straight into safe custody in the enemy jail when they're killed. To get them out of there, one of their teammates will have to fight his
way into the enemy base and trigger the jail release switch that's hidden there (Jailbreak!). It is your task to defend your prison release
switch and to free your own teammates when they're in jail. If your opponents manage to get all members of your team in prison, the opposing
team will score a point, and your team will die a horrible death.

Jailbreak strongly focuses on team play and forces players to take on different roles for their team as the game goes on: defending their
release switch, going into offense to frag opponents, or attacking the enemy base to release your own team members from prison. You'll have
to be a versatile player to survive and win a game of Jailbreak.
