## Introduction

The ArenaMaster mod was first conceptualized in September of 2003. As part of a spirited plan to enhance Unreal Tournament,
it introduces a new form of online tournament competition for the Unreal Tournament series. Inspired by thoroughbred horse
racing, the intention behind the mod is to introduce a type of natural handicapping that would even gameplay between the
leet and n00b players, attracting an increasing number of players. The current gametypes and levels for Unreal Tournament
have been so mastered by skilled players that match outcomes can be predicted even before they begin. With ArenaMaster,
the underdog in any given match will always have a chance to win. It is the belief of the ArenaMaster development team that
by leveling the playing field, this dynamic has the beneficial outcome of enhancing the overall experience of all players
in the online gaming environment. Upon releasing the first version for beta testing in late March 2004 after the launch
of Unreal Tournament 2004, the team has play-tested this mod for tens of thousands of hours. The team incorporated a tremendous
amount of feedback producing over 40 revisions, and has added many features successfully meeting its overall objective:
to create a game flow dynamic that leads to fun, exciting, and suspenseful gameplay.

## How To Play:

1. Player spawns with full health, armor, weapons, and ammo.
2. No player can fire or be damaged during the first few seconds of play.
3. Kill all other players on the board (or opposing team players for TAM).
4. Each Kill may have bonuses attached, such as adrenaline or health
5. The last player alive receives a point (or team point). Then a new round begins.
6. The more points a player/team has, the less health and armor they spawn with
7. Score enough points (i.e. 7) and the match is won.

## Freon:

Based off of freeze tag, freon is a round based game, built off of TAMs gameplay. Instead of just killing a player
and eliminating him from the round, he is frozen.

1. Player spawns with full health, armor, weapons, and ammo.
2. No player can fire or be damaged during the first few seconds of play.
3. Freeze all of the opposing teams players to score for your team, by dealing them lethal damage.
4. Unfreeze friendly players by standing next to them (will be indicated by a sound).
5. Recieve adrenaline for kills and damage.
6. Adrenaline combos effect your entire team.
7. Use speed combo to thaw teammates faster.
8. While unfrozen, huddle with teammates to regerate some health.
9. The more points a player/team has, the less health and armor they spawn with
10. Score enough points (i.e. 7) and the match is won.

- Thawed teammates only return with as much health as the player who thawed them.
- Lava thaws frozen players instantly.
- Huddling can only bring you close to the amount of health had by the healthiest player.
- Once your armor is gone, you can't get it back.
- Special thanks to L7 for writing the first freezetag mod for UT2kx.
