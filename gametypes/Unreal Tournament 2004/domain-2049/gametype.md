## Concept

Domain is a tactical, team based FPS, set in the year 2049 in a totalitarian world of a dominant global government, underground rebellion
and sinister corporations.

### Featuring 4 unique teams:

**The USE**: The security forces of the global government, USE forces are well equipped, brutal forces of the state, quick to suppress any
potential threat to the state.

**Rebels**: An underground resistance movement, operating in small cells the rebel movement hide beneath the cities and in the wilderness,
swift
guerrilla attack is their main form of attack.

**Corporations**: The corporations of the new age have their own law, corporate agents are a lethal force that strike fear into the hearts
of
those who see them.

**Gangs**: In the sprawling mass of the city the gangs control their stomping grounds through violent reprisal against all who stand against
them, their only threat is rival gangs, fighting for control of the drug supply networks.

### Gameplay modes:

In the released public alpha there is only one gameplay mode example:

**Objective match**: 2 teams fight to achieve a chain of objectives to win the match.

We have more gameplay modes planned:

**Resource control**: Up to 4 teams must collect and return to their homebase a set value of resources which have to be collected from a
central
location, this mode is best described as capture the flag with a twist.

**Hostage rescue/VIP escort**: As seen in other tactical team games

## Story

The year is 2049, after the tumultuous wars that defined the early 21st century an uneasy peace has been found at the cost of the freedom of
nations. Under a single global government, the United States of Earth, national identity has fallen by the wayside for all but a few
remaining 'rogue states'.

The USE maintains order with an iron grip, surveillance cameras on every street quickly pinpoint potential discontent or insurgence, the
central information network ensures no citizen moves where they shouldn’t or meets with those who might lead to anti-state actions. The
motto of the USE is a single word: Control.

However lurking in the shadows, careful to avoid the electric surveillance rebellion does exist. Small, organised cells of guerrilla
fighters lead raids on USE command and control, supply and information centres, attempting to undermine the all-pervading control of the
totalitarian state, to spread word of hope to the people that one day a new freedom could exist. Living in the wastelands and beneath the
streets of the cities the rebel movement seek to break through the control, their very existence is denied by the authorities, who claim
that little more than an occasional wayward citizen acting alone in madness is responsible for the increasing insurgence...but the
population are beginning to believe...

Underpinning the control systems of the USE are the powerful corporations, having built their power bases on the supply contracts for the
global wars of the past 50 years their own private security teams are highly trained, well equipped and ruthless. Corporate security agents
are feared among the population more than USE security sweeps kicking in their doors, the sight of a sharp suited agent strikes fear into
the heart of all who see them, sending citizens scurrying for cover and praying that their own thoughts or feelings may be the reason for
their appearance. Whispers among the population believe that these agents and the USE may be one and the same, but whether the USE control
the corporations or vice versa has never been known. All that is known is that if they come knocking at your door, you'll never be heard of
again and it wouldn't be wise to question that disappearance or speak of those who have been targeted.

The cities of the new age, giant sprawling urban masses, are also the home to violent gangs. Left unchecked by the security services in the
darkest areas of the cities lawlessness exists in an almost polar opposition to the totalitarian system that controls the majority of the
population. The lawless zones are infrequently visited by the USE and in turn the gangs provide their own form of control, creating a
dependency on their existence through their network of drug labs and supply, it is whispered that the meanest USE security troops often
launch their security sweeps tanked up on a narcotic high and that the gangs and their slum fortresses are as much a tool of the USE as a
thorn in the side, either way the dependence on their chemical filth helps maintain the status quo, with the ants of the cities working long
and hard to feed their addiction, daring not to speak or even think out of line for fear of losing the one tiny escape from their lives.
