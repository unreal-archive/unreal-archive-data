## What is FHI?

The Skaarj are a persistent race, actively seeking and waging war against everyone that crosses their path. Since the development of the
Unreal Tournament combat area in 2291, the Liandri Corporation has had a more pressing issue on its hands - namely the declaration of war
against the Skaarj and the resources required to facilitate such a bloodthirsty fight. Fraghouse Invasion recreates the minor and major
fights that took place during the year-long war between Liandri and the Skaarj race, highlighting several key battles and other events
worthy of note.

Fraghouse Invasion (FHI) is a modification (MOD) for Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT2004). FHI takes the stock Invasion gametype and adds several
twists, monsters and many other features.

Unlike the Invasion gametype, FHI monsters are spawned at specific locations throughout the map as chosen by the level designer giving the
opportunity to create defendable areas and bases. This is the basic change that has always been present throughout development of the mod.

FHI contains a whole array of custom built maps, and a large and varied selection of weapons, items and special pickups. Maps typically
focus on the structured defence of an area, such as a building or construction.
