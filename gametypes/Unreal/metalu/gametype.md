Metal is an Arena Shooter game developed by the independent Developer and Publisher; Idigicon Limited (Based in the UK) in 2002. The game
has a strong connection to Quake 3 and some minor resemblance to Unreal Tournament 1999.

Metal used to be sold at different Hypermarkets in Europe including Hungary where it rose to notoriety due to the "Hungarian AVGN; Rossz PC
Játékok Sorozat. (Bad PC Games Series)

The reviewer made fun of the game's lazy design, ugly graphics and a generally bad gameplay.

Although a Quake 3 copycat; the game came with pretty much no options in regards of controls, graphics, sound, music. And the biggest flaw,
there's no multiplayer in the game. (Why would anyone want to play this?)
These are the things we aim to change in our port/remake. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE INTEND ON KEEPING THE MOD AS AUTHENTIC TO THE ORIGINAL ONE AS
POSSIBLE! With some extras of course.
The extras include:

- New maps and map variants: (Please note that the ORIGINAL MAPS LOOK LIKE THIS: DmMetalMTL01.unr)
  - UNR variant = Metal maps but Unreal pickups.
  - Jumpboot = Metal maps but with my custom Jumpboots placed.
  - Railgun = Metal maps but with my custom-made Railgun placed.
  - More Pickups = Metal maps but with more pickups placed.
- New items: Rocket Pack, Jumpboots, and a Railgun analog called the Desintegrator + Desintegrator Skins
