## About

The Crystal Castles Mod is the first new extensive mod to be created for Unreal I in a Nali's age. Play is a bit different from what you may
be used to. Points are what matters - not the total number of kills. Points are awarded for kills but you may find it easier to pick up the
high scores by collecting the gems and gold found throughout the levels.

Those who used to play the old 2-D arcade games where you run around and pick up gems (dots, etc) will be familiar with the concept. The
change is we have moved from a static 2-D world into the third dimension.

Our Mod name "Crystal Castles" pays a bit of homage to the original Crystal Castles arcade game - it was actually the first 3D venture along
this direction. Needless to say things have changed a bit since it came out. We bring you a little closer to the action by placing you in a
first person viewpoint.

Other changes are that you are a little better armed than that poor old Bentley Bear being chased by trees and other rotten baddies. You
also can pick up a bunch of special items to help you win the day. But don't get complacent, more monsters are around to pound you into mush
and also other players will be competing with you for that top score!!
