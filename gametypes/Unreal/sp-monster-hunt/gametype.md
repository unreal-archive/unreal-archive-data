SP Monster Hunt is a team based modification for UnrealTournament ported to Unreal.

In Monster Hunt, you and your team of hunters (humans or bots) must work your way through the level while killing everything that stands in
your way. Monsters you'll face range from the tiny but deadly Pupae, to slimy Sliths that spew blobs of slime at you, to the huge
stone-throwing Titans.

Players must work as a team to survive, players on their own will be overpowered by the monsters and sent back to the beginning of the
level. Players shouldn't grab all the health and ammo as they come to it, it should be shared out amongst the players who need it most, or
you could let one player grab lots of health and pick-ups and he can then charge the monsters to weaken them, the other players following.
All this also adds a bit of strategy to the gameplay.
