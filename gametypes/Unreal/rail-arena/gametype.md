This is a simple deathmatch mod. All players start with the railgun, and all the weapons in the level are replaced with the railgun.

The railgun is a single hit weapon (for unarmored opponents). Your goal: shoot people.

In addition to getting points for killing people, you can get "streak bonuses". When you get 4, 8, etc hits in a row, without missing, then
you'll get a random bonus. There are about 7 different bonuses. Also, the most accurate player and the person with the longest hit streak
will be shown on the scoreboard.
