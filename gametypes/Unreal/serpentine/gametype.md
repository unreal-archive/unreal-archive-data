Serpentine is a conversion for Unreal. It centers around the concept of replacing the Unreal weapons with modern real-world firearms. It
moves the emphasis of play off quick reflexes and dodging, on to tactical thinking and guile. The goal was to create a more believable, more
visceral deathmatch environment, and to bring back the kind of satisfying firepower that we miss from the days of Doom.

If you find normal Unreal to be too twitchy, or don't find the original weapons to be very satisfying, Serpentine may be just what you've
been hoping for. On the other hand, if you're looking for arcade action and you enjoy being able to dodge and jump with inhuman agility, you
likely won't enjoy Serpentine much; it was never intended to be for everyone.

All in all, Serpentine represents a serious effort to recapture the feeling of enjoyment that we get from recreational shooting, and to boil
that experience down into a deathmatch format for our lan parties. In Serpentine there's a lot of fancy hardware that we only wish we could
own, but they all share a common feel with the way our guns behave, and look, and sound.
