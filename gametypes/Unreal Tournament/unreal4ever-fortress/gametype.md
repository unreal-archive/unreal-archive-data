U4eFortress combines the classic tactical TeamFortress combat with even more classical RPG features, spices everything up with the well
known splendour of U4e weapon functionality and optics, and finally brings you to a wholly new gaming experience by smoothly fitting in a
magical system containing a total of 67 spells, each of them more unique than many many other systems of commercial games.

In U4E-Fortress, you choose Professions to train your U4E Monster classes in. These effect the abilities of your characters and the weapons
they spawn with. And even the professions themselves are far from cut and dry Fortress standards. For instance, the Cyberknight wields
techno-medieval weapons and has the ability to call down Particle Cannon blasts from outerspace. And the Wizard uses an RPG experience
system to learn from a list of over 50 different spells from 6 schools of magic. (Ever wanted to turn somebody into a Rabbit?). It's like
Harry Potter with pubs! And every Profession comes fully stocked with new weapons and abilities, never before seen in any other U4E release!

U4E-Gauntlet is completely new kind of game. It's based on an "US-Vs-THEM" style gameplay, reminiscent of DOOM2 Co-Op, where all players and
bots face off against an ARMY of monsters that pour through Gateways, spread all over the level. Destroy the gateways at any cost, or face
an overwhelming army of Unreal and U4E's most savage monsters! And U4E-Jailbreak is Holger's person recreation of the classic Jailbreak
game, with all of the fun filled insanity you've come to expect from Unreal4Ever!

This release requires the UTv436 patch and both UT Bonus Pack #1 and Bonus Pack #4.
