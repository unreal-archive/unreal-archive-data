Monster Hunt is a team based modification for Unreal Tournament
comprising two new game types, Monster Hunt and Monster Arena.

In Monster Hunt, you and your team of hunters (humans or bots) must work
your way through the level while killing everything that stands in your
way. Monsters you'll face range from the tiny but deadly Pupae, to slimy
Sliths that spew blobs of slime at you, to the huge stone-throwing
Titans.

Monster Hunt is the perfect blend of multiplayer and single player, single
player in the sense that the levels and style of Monster Hunt are very much
like that of a single player game, but the team based gameplay gives it a
great multiplayer feel.

Players must work as a team to survive, players on their own will be
overpowered by the monsters and sent back to the beginning of the level.
Players shouldn't grab all the health and ammo as they come to it, it
should be shared out amongst the players who need it most, or you could
let one player grab lots of health and pick-ups and he can then charge
the monsters to weaken them, the other players following. All this also
adds a bit of strategy to the gameplay.

Monster Arena is very differant from Monster Hunt, in Monster Arena, you
and your team aren't batteling your way through the level to get to the
boss at the end, rather you are faced with one extremely powerful
monster that must be killed.
