Double Domination is a two team game only, with only two DDOM points, one for 
Red, and one for Blue. Your team MUST hold both of the points for 8 seconds, 
and when you have done that, your team gets a point. When you get a point, the
next round commences. The average team score target in a map is around 3-5.
