Working as science teacher in an inner-city highschool, life 
is not always served to you on a silver platter.  Although you were brought up
in a strict family, and went on to serve as a Bio-chemist working
highly classified assignments involving sensative materials and even
more sensative security measures, sometimes the past doesn't prepare
you for what's to come.

Only two short weeks ago, bloodtests discovered a rare and unknown disease
quickly eating away your immune system.  Doctors claimed you only had a few
short months to live, but would remain stable for a couple weeks.  Everything
uncertain, you knew that you had to take matters into your own hands.  After
more self conducted bloodtests, and research, you found just what you needed
to hear.

5 years earlier, you had just had your papers cleared for departure from the
United States Army Biochemistry Lab.  With only two weeks remaining, there was
still work to be done and chemicals to be researched.  Thats when you remembered it.

Firmus Morti 13.

You had been given the assignment to check the lifespan of the biowarfare chemical
after being exposed to the sister vaccine made to eliminate the deadly effects of
the virus.  Now it dawned on you that the same characteristics of life decay were
held by FM13 that now threatened your life.

The vaccine was held in an underground facility located in a covert Military warehouse
used to store various common-use items.  The only thing standing between you and the
cure to your problems was the door and your handcannon.
