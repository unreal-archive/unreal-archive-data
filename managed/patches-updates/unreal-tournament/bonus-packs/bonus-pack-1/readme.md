## Epic Games Presents Bonus Pack 1

This pack is our way of saying "Thank you!" to the gamers out there who have supported Epic.

> NOTE: If you installed the game from Steam, you should already have this content.


### New Characters

These models are available to play as under "Player Setup." You can configure your bots to use these meshes as well by clicking the
"Configure" button under the "Bot" tab when you start a Practice Session.

#### Skaarj Hybrid

The N.E.G. has long recognized the superiority of the Skaarj warrior as a military fighting machine, as was made clear in the brutal
Human-Skaarj wars. The Skaarj Hybrid is the result of secret military genetic research using both human and Skaarj DNA performed after the
capture of a Skaarj scout ship. If proven in Tournament battle, the Hybrids shall become a leading force in ground based ops.

#### Nali

The Nali race has been long enslaved and dominated by the Skaarj. A newly formed Nali faction has repented their pacifist ways and has
rebelled against the Skaarj, and they're ready to prove their combat skills in the Tournament.

#### Nali WarCow

When the militant Nali were driven from their homeworld they brought the only domesticated beast they knew of- their local livestock. By
using Pavlovian techniques and heavy cerebral modification they are training their cattle to fight instead of graze.


### New Levels

> Maps with a "16" in their name are intended for 16 players minimum.

#### DM-Agony

Sidney "Clawfist" Rauchberger has assembled a cool FFA map in the style of Codex, but not as cramped. The Shock Rifle is very dangerous on
this map as many of the floors are long and flat and combo moves are easy to do. This map plays well with 6-10 players.

#### DM-Cybrosis][

Alan Willard converted his Fusion map to UT and enhanced it considerably. Beware of the new electric trap near the Damage Amplifier! This
map plays well with 10-16 players.

#### DM-ArcaneTemple

Shane Caudle works his ancient temple magic once more. This lovely map plays well with 6-12 players.

#### DM-Malevolence

Rich "Akuma" Eastwood made this fantastic Tourney (1 on 1) map. This map will play okay with 6-8 players but is really meant for one on one
play.

#### DM-Shrapnel][

This map was originally released in a free Unreal1 map pack by Epic called "Fusion." Cliff Bleszinski has greatly ripped it apart and
reworked it so that it is less cramped and plays far better. This map plays well with many players, from 10 to 16.

#### DM-HealPod][

Healpod originally shipped with Unreal1. The premise behind the level is that there is no health in it, instead, there is a "pod" in the
center of the level that will restore 15 health every second. Now, the level has buttons strategically placed throughout it where players
can touch them and cause a masher to deploy which will squish all who are in the pod at the time. This map plays well with 8-12 players.

#### DM-Mojo][

Mojo is a hardcore twisty castle corridor deathmatch map by Cliff Bleszinski. It is meant for 6-12 players.

#### CTF-Cybrosis][

Alan Willard's Capture the Flag conversion of DM-Cybrosis][.

#### CTF-Hydro16

Clawfist has built a top notch "two bases" industrial style Capture the Flag map. Like all of the other Capture the Flag maps in the Bonus
Pack plays this map really needs 16 players or more to shine.

#### CTF-Noxion16

Another great dueling base Capture the Flag map courtesy of Clawfist. Needs 16 players for optimal action.

#### CTF-Darji16

Alan Willard started building this map one day and it grew into the impressive behmoth that is Darji Fortress. This map is meant for 16
players and is quite a challenge to capture the flag in.


### Relics

Relics are added into an Unreal Tournament game like mutators are. You can add as many or as few as your heart desires. They each spawn over
a random pathnode and move around the map if nobody picks them up after a short interval. They can be used with any gametype that Unreal
Tournament supports!

You can only carry one relic at a time.

If you bind a key like this at the console (press `, or "tilde" to access the console):

	E=mutate TossRelic

You can then press that key to drop your current relic. Be sure to type that exactly, as it is case sensitive.

(Or, you can open your USER.INI file and add it in yourself.)

There are six relics.

#### Relic of Strength

This relic is shaped like an axe. When you carry this any damage you do will be multiplied by 2, and when you shoot you'll have a purple
shell encase your mesh for a split second to let others know that you're powered up with this relic.

#### Relic of Regeneration

Shaped like a cross. When you carry this you'll gain 10 health every 2
seconds up to 150. In my opinion, this is the weakest of the Relics.

#### Relic of Defense

This relic is shaped like a helmet. It reduces all damage by half, after armor. You'll be tough to take down while carrying this relic. When
you're hit while carrying this relic you will be encased in a green shell briefly to let the attacker know you've got upgraded defenses.

#### Relic of Speed

Shaped like a hourglass. Increases GroundSpeed, WaterSpeed, AirSpeed, and
Acceleration by 30%. Sets AirControl to 0.65.

#### Relic of Redemption

This relic is shaped like a spiked disc, ala "chaos."  If you take fatal damage while carrying this you
will be randomly moved somewhere in the level, your health will be restored
and you will still have your inventory. Its like a second chance.

#### Relic of Vengeance

Shaped like a grinning skull. If you die while carrying this a large skull
will appear above your corpse. After 1.5 seconds it will explode
annihilating anyone in the area.
