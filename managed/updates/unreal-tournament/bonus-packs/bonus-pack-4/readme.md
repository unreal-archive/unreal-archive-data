## Epic Games Presents Bonus Pack 4

Happy Holidays, and thanks for downloading the official Epic Games Bonus Pack 4.

This pack contains two new player characters and 12 maps.

The characters are "Xan - Mark II," and "WarBoss."

- **Xan Mark II**: After his defeat in the Tournament, Xan has been rebuilt from the ground up. He's stronger, faster, and a hell of a lot
  meaner looking.
- **WarBoss**: Liandri researchers have been experimenting with recently uncovered Skaarj technology and have been implementing their
  results in a new model. Dubbed "Warboss," he's the fastest and most agile robot ever produced.

These characters are higher poly than the original UT characters, so you may see a slow down on slower systems. If these characters fail to
show up properly in a network game, check the `UnrealTournament.ini` file (in your `UnrealTournament\System` directory).  
In the `[Engine.GameEngine]` section, there are several ServerPackages lines. Make sure that this line is there:

```
ServerPackages=SkeletalChars
```

Maps:

- **CTF-Beautitude**: Medium sized Ancient temple CTF.
