description: "J\x05'Anima Ex Machina', or Spirit in the Machine. These mining facilities\
  \ on Arborea were abandoned long ago, and yet something from the etheral plane keeps\
  \ the machinery in operation. However, competitors here won't have time to contemplate\
  \ such ghost stories, as the reality they face in this tournament will be far more\
  \ dangerous."
