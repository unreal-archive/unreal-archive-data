description: "N\x04The shift-horn's cry marks end of day.||By day, the sky is turned\
  \ red with shattered brick and airbourne dust.||By night the ground runs red for\
  \ darker reasons altogether.||Take heart! All work and no play maks you a dull boy,\
  \ so take up your tools and work up a sweat."
