description: "}\x04Anfractuous: winding; tortuous; full of twists and turns. This\
  \ building has been heavily modified for use in the Tournament; few traces remain\
  \ of its original purpose. Anfractuous caters to the offensive team, allowing flag\
  \ carriers to easily evade their pursuers - there's little room for defense here\
  \ - cap or die!"
