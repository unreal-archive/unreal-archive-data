description: "M\x06An earthquake has hit a modest city. Most buildings survived the\
  \ rumble...with the exception of a few older buildings. The city's power infrastructure\
  \ is on the brink. Random aftershocks still exist from the quake. The city's power\
  \ is distributed by transmission towers, and 2 main cores built into the city's\
  \ two biggest skyscrapers. Two groups of militia are determined to take control\
  \ of them."
