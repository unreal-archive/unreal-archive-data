description: "z\x06Deep solar mining facility Epsilon stationed in the Kuiper Belt\
  \ was impacted by a rogue asteroid, propelling it violently out of the solar system\
  \ into uncharted space.  The leaders of Federated Earth estimated that a recovery\
  \ operation would take three years.  The colony of miners soon exhausted their resources\
  \ of food, water and oxygen, altering the once organized and cooperative team into\
  \ total anarchy and a bloody battle for survival."
