description: "{\bAfter decades Tibet is still occupied by China. Because of the need\
  \ of money chinese authorities rent the buddhist shrines and monasteries to deathmatches.\
  \ So they continue with their aim to destroy tibetan culture and religion. This\
  \ valley is one of these sacred places, during the day it transforms into an arena\
  \ for the bloody show, but when night comes and the guns are silent again, the monks\
  \ and nuns  are coming back to meditate in the spirit of buddha and pray for a peacefull\
  \ and FREE TIBET. May their wish come true and may every living being find enlightment!"
