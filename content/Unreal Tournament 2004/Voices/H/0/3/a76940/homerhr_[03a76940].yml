description: "This voicepack was created by direct sound capturing from 'The Simpsons: Hit and Run' game. \
  \ Because I am is extreme Simpson's and Unreal Tournament 2004 fan, I buy this game especially for creating this voicepack :) \
  \ Now, at two years after I start this 'hard work', I am not sure I was captured all possible Homer's jokes and screams - I am just in a middle of game now ;) \
  \ But because I too lazy for continue process, I release this voicepack as is, on this time. \
  \ I hope you enjoy all this Homer Simson's jokes as much as I do. \
  \ Have fun! :) "
