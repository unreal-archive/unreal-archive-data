description: "There are TWO Mutators in this pack, one does set the default AmbientGlow for the Players to 0, so, when you go to the shadows, the mesh model gets really dark, and the other is the opposite, makes the default AmbientGlow 100%, so, even on very dark shadows, players still 100% visible."
