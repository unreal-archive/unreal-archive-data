- name: "UT3 Like the Back of My Hand"
  description: "Addds a counter of all the pickups in the map and how many of those\
    \ you have picked up already, and does an announcement when you manage pick up\
    \ all of them. This way it emulates UT3 award 'Like the Back of My Hand' and promotes\
    \ map exploration."
- name: "UT3 InstaGib"
  description: "Instant-kill combat with modified UT3 Shock Rifles."
- name: "UT3 Weapon Streak Announcement"
  description: "Announces streaks for every weapon, not just for Flak Monkeys and\
    \ Combo Whores. This version works with the UT3 weapon variants."
- name: "UT3 Weapons"
  description: "Modifies UT2004 weapons so they work similarly to their UT3 counterparts."
weapons:
- name: "UT3 Longbow AVRiL"
  description: "The Longbow Anti-Vehicle Rocket Launcher, a.k.a. the 'AVRiL', gives\
    \ dismounted infantry a fighting chance in an armored conflict. Its solid fuel\
    \ missile can be 'dumbfired' as an unguided rocket, but the AVRiL's famed kill\
    \ percentages come from its optical tracking system.|The alternate fire zooms\
    \ and locks on to a vehicle, guiding the missile towards its target at inescapable\
    \ speeds. The missile's microdappled control planes use increased surface area\
    \ to give unprecedented turning radius, guaranteeing delivery of its shaped PolyDiChlorite\
    \ charge into all but the most nimble vehicles.|The AVRiL is notoriously slow\
    \ to reload, so it should be employed with caution in a pitched battle.|Note,\
    \ the Longbow's targeting laser is (not yet) standardized for most Axon military\
    \ equipment, so it can be used in other battlefield applications such as directing\
    \ spider mines."
- name: "UT3 Bio Rifle"
  description: "The GES BioRifle processes Tarydium from its stable crystalline form\
    \ into a reactive mutagenic sludge. It can rapidly disperse these toxins for wide-area\
    \ coverage, or fire a virulent payload of variable, but usually lethal, capacity.\
    \ In layman's terms, this means the BioRifle can pepper an area with small globs\
    \ of biosludge, or launch one noxious glob at the target. The BioRifle's ability\
    \ to carpet an area with a toxic minefield makes it a notoriously effective defensive\
    \ weapon."
- name: "UT3 Enforcer"
  description: "For decades, the Enforcer pistol was the combat sidearm of choice.\
    \ Veteran soldiers appreciated the lightweight handgun's power, accuracy, and\
    \ balance. In recent years, the ever-burning desire for greater firepower led\
    \ to general issue of the AR770 assault rifle. Military procurement officers were\
    \ drawn to the AR770's higher cyclic rate and underslung M355 grenade launcher,\
    \ but seasoned combatants missed the dependability of the Enforcer. Axon Research\
    \ listened to the soldiers, and their new Enforcer MP ('Machine Pistol') model\
    \ provides the best of both worlds. Side-fed magazines provide greater capacity,\
    \ while balancing the shooter's aim when wielding two pistols. With a deadly accurate\
    \ semi-automatic mode, and a selectable burst fire mode, the Enforcer is back,\
    \ and the modern battlefield will never be the same."
- name: "UT3 Flak Cannon"
  description: "Trident Defensive Technologies continues to tweak and refine the flak\
    \ cannon with their newly released Mk4 'Peacekeeper.' In spite of its new name,\
    \ the flak cannon remains banned from most military conflicts for high incidences\
    \ of maiming and collateral damage. Still, the flak cannon is the weapon of choice\
    \ for unconventional warfare in urban terrain. The primary mode detonates the\
    \ flak shell in the barrel, launching shrapnel forward in a deadly shotgun pattern\
    \ but often deafening the operator. The cannon also lobs an explosive flak shell\
    \ that detonates on contact, sending shrapnel in a dangerously wide and unpredictable\
    \ radius."
- name: "UT3 Impact Hammer"
  description: "The Impact Hammer, originally designed for sub-surface drift mining,\
    \ can focus several hundred metric tons of pressure into the space of a few square\
    \ centimeters. The impact, and resulting shock wave, easily destabilizes solid\
    \ stone to speed ore separation and excavation. After several mining accidents\
    \ highlighted the Hammer's devastating effect on the human body, the N.E.G. military\
    \ took interest. To improve the Hammer's effectiveness against vehicles with shock-absorbing\
    \ armor, an alternate electromagnetic pulse (EMP) mode was added. The EMP violently\
    \ scrambles onboard computer systems, quickly leading to engine failure. Field\
    \ testing showed the EMP has a similar effect on infantry powerups, knocking them\
    \ off soldiers and enabling battlefield recovery."
- name: "UT3 Link Gun"
  description: "Riordan Dynamic Weapon Systems combines the best of weapon design\
    \ in the Advanced Plasma Rifle v23, commonly known as the Link Gun.|While the\
    \ primary firing mode of the Link remains the same as its plasma-firing predecessor,\
    \ the secondary cutting torch has been replaced with a switchable energy matrix.\
    \ Upon contacting a teammate, it converts to a harmless carrier stream, offloading\
    \ energy from the onboard cells to boost the output of any targeted player also\
    \ using the Link.|It should be noted that while players are boosting a teammate,\
    \ they are unable to defend themselves from attack."
- name: "UT3 Stinger Minigun"
  description: "Replacing the Minigun in this year's Tournament, the 'Stinger' is\
    \ actually a Liandri mining tool converted into military service.|The Stinger\
    \ fires shards of unprocessed Tarydium crystal at an alarming rate, raking opponents\
    \ with a storm of deadly needles. The alternate fire shoots larger hunks of crystal\
    \ that can knock back an opponent, sometimes even pinning them to walls."
- name: "UT3 Redeemer"
  description: "'Even your least effective soldiers will earn a respectable bodycount\
    \ with this tactical nuclear device.' So said the original brochure for the Redeemer,\
    \ still unchallenged in its role as the most powerful man-portable weapon system\
    \ known through the galaxy.|The slow-moving but utterly devastating missile, affectionately\
    \ known as 'Lola' by veteran soldiers, now uses an Enhanced Radiation payload.\
    \ This ensures maximum tissue failure without undue property damage, perfect for\
    \ modern assault-and-capture tactics.|The Redeemer's alternate mode fires the\
    \ missile using the disposable fly-by-wire guidance system, though the manual\
    \ recommends using this mode only in areas of relative safety."
- name: "UT3 Rocket Launcher"
  description: "Each year, more accidental deaths are caused by the Trident Tri-barrel\
    \ Rocket Launcher than in vehicular accidents and extreme sports combined. The\
    \ kill radius for its standard dumbfire rocket is surprisingly high by design\
    \ - so accidentally firing upon a nearby wall, or a nearby enemy soldier, can\
    \ be quite fatal for the operator. The alternate fire adds to this suicidal lethality\
    \ by loading and firing up to three rockets at once, in a spread, tight spiral,\
    \ or lobbed like grenades. Regardless of the grim statistics, veteran soldiers\
    \ still consider the 'old 8 ball' the most expedient way to put explosive ordnance\
    \ on target."
- name: "UT3 Shock Rifle"
  description: "The ASMD Shock Rifle has changed little since its first incorporation\
    \ into the Liandri Tournament. The ASMD sports two firing modes: a thin photon\
    \ beam, and a sphere of unstable plasma energy. These modes are each deadly in\
    \ their own right, but used together they can neutralize opponents in a devastating\
    \ shockwave. The energy spheres can be detonated with the photon beam, releasing\
    \ the explosive energy of the anti-photons in the plasma's EM containment field."
- name: "UT3 Sniper Rifle"
  description: "The venerable Axon Research long-range target interdiction rifle is\
    \ the weapon of choice for the discerning sniper. Acquisition of a target at distance\
    \ requires a steady hand, but the rewards merit the effort: the high-caliber round\
    \ is lethal at any range. With a precise headshot, the target will be neutralized\
    \ by the super-sonic bullet long before they hear the report. As they say in the\
    \ N.E.G. Marines: 'any shot you hear is nothing to be worried about.'"
- name: "UT3 Translocator"
  description: "The Translocator was originally designed by Liandri R&D for rapid\
    \ rescue of expensive mining equipment during tunnel collapses and related emergencies.\
    \ The technology also saved couintless lives, but not without a cost: rapid deresolution\
    \ and reconstitution led to synaptic disruptions, and the debilitating symptoms\
    \ like Teleportation Related Dementia (TReDs).||Today, after years of lucrative\
    \ military development contracts, portable teleportation technology has been declared\
    \ 'sufficiently safe' for regular use by frontline infantry."
