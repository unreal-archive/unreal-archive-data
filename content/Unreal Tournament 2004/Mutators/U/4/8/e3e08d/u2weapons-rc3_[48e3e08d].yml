weapons:
- name: "Duster Combat Assault Rifle"
  description: "The M32 Duster Comber Assault Rifle is the standard infantry weapon\
    \ for the Terran Military grunt. Very effective overall - you can hose down an\
    \ area using the primary fire mode or deliver a lethal single punch with the alternate\
    \ fire."
- name: "Auto Turret"
  description: "The Automatic Turret is an automated deployable, used as field support\
    \ or as an automated defence. It has a dual mounted chaingun that has properties\
    \ similar to the ones of Combat Assault Rifle."
- name: "Deployable Item"
  description: "Deployable Item"
- name: "Proximity Sensor"
  description: "Proximity Sensors are small devices made entirely for scanning the\
    \ area for any activity. When in the area, scanned by radio waves, a living object\
    \ appears, it has to have the team's identification badge, otherwise the Proximity\
    \ Sensor automatically sets off an alarm."
- name: "Shark Rocket Launcher"
  description: "Nothing beats the primary fire mode of the Shark Rocket Launcher for\
    \ accurate, long-range devastation with significant splash damage. The alt-fire\
    \ drunken missiles are wildly unpredictable, but are good for saturating an area\
    \ or providing suppressing fire."
- name: "Duster Combat Assault Rifle"
  description: "The M32 Duster Comber Assault Rifle is the standard infantry weapon\
    \ for the Terran Military grunt. Very effective overall - you can hose down an\

- name: "Shock Lance"
  description: "The Shock Lance Energy Rifle is the favourite weapon of the Izarians,\
    \ the strike force of one of the Skaarj clans. The Izarians use the weapon mainly\
    \ for frightening enemies, as a beacon for Skaarj or to fry electronics. Therefore\
    \ it isn't at all effective against enemies, but extremely effective against vehicles\
    \ and deployables."
- name: "Field Generator"
  description: "The Field Generator is a small device that, when within proximity\
    \ of another Field Generator, creates a strong force field that stops enemies\
    \ from going through."
- name: "Vulcan Flamethrower"
  description: "The UA69 Vulcan Flamethrower is the most lethal short-range weapon\
    \ in the Terran arsenal - you can incinerate entire squads of enemies at close\
    \ quarters."
- name: "Hydra Grenade Launcher"
  description: "The M406 Hydra Grenade Launcher is an amazingly versatile and effective\
    \ piece of military hardware, perhaps the best all-around portable weapon in the\
    \ Terran arsenal. It uses universal Grenades that explode in various ways."
- name: "Land Mine"
  description: "Land Mines are explosives that detonate when anyone trips over them.\
    \ They are extremely lethal - there is almost no chance of surviving the blast\
    \ if you trip on one. Be very cautious, because friendly mines are almost as dangerous\
    \ as enemy mines."
- name: "Laser Trip Mine"
  description: "TG-17 anti-personnel explosive Laser Trip Mines are often useful for\
    \ sealing off areas. They emit a small laser beam that helps them scan the area\
    \ for any kind of movement. Once it's detected, the Laser Trip Mine detonates."
- name: "Magnum Pistol"
  description: "The Magnum is the most powerful sidearm out there. Best for medium\
    \ range targets, when you’re too far away for the shotgun, but too close for the\
    \ sniper rifle.|The pistol uses special 0.50 caliber explosive bullets that are\
    \ quite rare, but powerful. They explode a few miliseconds after hitting the target,\
    \ effectively incinerating its internal organs."
- name: "Shark Rocket Launcher"
  description: "Nothing beats the primary fire mode of the Shark Rocket Launcher for\
    \ accurate, long-range devastation with significant splash damage. The alt-fire\
    \ drunken missiles are wildly unpredictable, but are good for saturating an area\
    \ or providing suppressing fire."
- name: "Rocket Turret"
  description: "The Rocket Turret is an automated deployable, used as field support\
    \ or as an automated defence. It has a dual mounted Rocket Launcher that fires\
    \ rockets similar to those of the Shark Rocket Launcher."
- name: "Widowmaker Sniper Rifle"
  description: "The T72 Widowmaker Sniper Rifle is a highly specialized weapon that\
    \ should be used only for long-range sniping, but it does its job very, very well.\
    \ Its targeting system compensates for wind and other variables to create an instant\
    \ hit on virtually any target you can see."
