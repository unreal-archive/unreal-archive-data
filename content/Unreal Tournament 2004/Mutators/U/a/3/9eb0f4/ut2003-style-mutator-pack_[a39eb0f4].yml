mutators:
- name: "[UT2003 Style] Extra announcements"
  description: "Adds extra announcements to stock gametypes ('Averted' into Double\
    \ Domination and 'Team Pass Completed' into Bombing Run)."

  description: "Bots do a random taunt if they win the match."
- name: "[UT2003 Style] Shock Core display fix"
  description: "Fixes the display of the Shock Core (ammo pickup for the Shock Rifle).||This\
    \ mutator will set the Shock Cores to have the dimensions (and therefore appearance)\
    \ of Shock Cores of Unreal, Unreal Tournament, Unreal Tournament 2003 and Unreal\
    \ Championship.|This mutator doesn't replace anything and therefore is compatibe\
    \ with other mutators. It is a mutator of the UT2003 style fixes by GreatEmerald."
- name: "[UT2003 Style] Super-Jump Combo"
  description: "Adds the Super-Jump combo (Forward-Back-Forward-Back).||This mutator\
    \ was made by Leo (T.C.K.) based on the UT2003 Beta code.|It isn't fully supported\
    \ by GreatEmerald."
- name: "[UT2003 Style] Extra functionality"
  description: "Adds additional functionality that is not related to weapons, such\
    \ as UT2003 teleportation effects, ragdoll sounds, etc."
- name: "[UT2003 Style] InstaGib"
  description: "Instagib with UT2003 Super Shock Rifles."
- name: "[UT2003 Style] UT2003 Weapons"

- name: "[UT2003 Style] Zoom InstaGib"
  description: "Instagib with UT2003 Super Shock Rifles and zoom functionality."
weapons:
- name: "UT2003 Assault Rifle"
  description: "Inexpensive and easily produced, the AR770 provides a lightweight\
    \ 5.56mm combat solution that is most effective against unarmored foes. With low-to-moderate\
    \ armor penetration capabilities, this rifle is best suited to a role as a light\
    \ support weapon.|The optional M355 Grenade Launcher provides the punch that makes\
    \ this weapon effective against heavily armored enemies.  Pick up a second assault\
    \ rifle to double your fire power."
- name: "UT2003 AVRiL"
  description: "The AVRiL, or Anti-Vehicle Rocket Launcher, shoots homing missiles\
    \ that pack quite a punch."
- name: "UT2003 Bio Rifle"
  description: "The GES BioRifle continues to be one of the most controversial weapons\
    \ in the Tournament. Loved by some, loathed by others, the BioRifle has long been\
    \ the subject of debate over its usefulness.||Some Tournament purists argue that\
    \ it is the equivalent of a cowardly minefield. Others argue that it enhances\
    \ the tactical capabilities of defensive combatants.|Despite the debate, the weapon\
    \ provides rapid-fire wide-area coverage in primary firing mode, and a single-fire\
    \ variable payload secondary firing mode. In layman's terms, this equates to being\
    \ able to pepper an area with small globs of Biosludge, or launch one large glob\
    \ at the target."
- name: "UT2003 Flak Cannon"
  description: "Trident Defensive Technologies Series 7 Flechette Cannon has been\
    \ taken to the next step in evolution with the production of the Mk3 Negotiator.\
    \ The ionized flechettes are capable of delivering second and third-degree burns\
    \ to organic tissue, cauterizing the wound instantly.||Payload delivery is achieved\
    \ via one of two methods: ionized flechettes launched in a spread pattern directly\
    \ from the barrel; or via fragmentation grenades that explode on impact, radiating\
    \ flechettes in all directions."
- name: "UT2003 Grenade Launcher"
  description: "The MGG Grenade Launcher fires magnetic sticky grenades, which will\
    \ attach to enemy players and vehicles."
- name: "UT2003 Link Gun"
  description: "Riordan Dynamic Weapon Systems combines the best of weapon design\
    \ in the Advanced Plasma Rifle v23, commonly known as the Link Gun.|While the\
    \ primary firing mode of the Link remains the same as its plasma-firing predecessor,\
    \ the secondary cutting torch has been replaced with a switchable energy matrix.\
    \ Upon contacting a teammate, it converts to a harmless carrier stream, offloading\
    \ energy from the onboard cells to boost the output of any targeted player also\
    \ using the Link.|It should be noted that while players are boosting a teammate,\
    \ they are unable to defend themselves from attack."
- name: "UT2003 Mine Layer"
  description: "The Spider Mine Layer is used for deploying spider mines, autonomous\
    \ mobile mines that are highly effective against both foot soldiers and vehicles."
- name: "UT2003 Minigun"
  description: "The Schultz-Metzger T23-A 23mm rotary cannon is capable of firing\
    \ both high-velocity caseless ammunition and cased rounds. With an unloaded weight\
    \ of only 8 kilograms, the T23 is portable and maneuverable, easily worn across\
    \ the back when employing the optional carrying strap.|The T23-A is the rotary\
    \ cannon of choice for the discerning soldier."
- name: "UT2003 Target Painter"
  description: "The Target Painter, similar to the Ion Painter, fires a harmless,\
    \ low power laser with its primary fire. Unlike the Ion Painter, however, this\
    \ weapon calls in a bomber that launches a string of bombs in the direction the\
    \ user is facing, centered on the painted target. The bombs will easily incinerate\
    \ the target and any unfortunates that happen to be nearby."
- name: "UT2003 Ion Painter"
  description: "The Ion Painter seems innocuous enough at first glance, emitting a\
    \ harmless low-power laser beam when the primary firing mode is engaged. Several\
    \ seconds later a multi-gigawatt orbital ion cannon fires on the target, neutralizing\
    \ any combatants in the vicinity.||The Ion Painter is a remote targeting device\
    \ used to orient and fire the VAPOR Ion Cannon. The Ion Painter offers increased\
    \ targeting accuracy via its telescopic sight, easily activated by the secondary\
    \ fire mode of the weapon.|Once the Ion Painter has been used to designate a target\
    \ it is highly recommended that the user put considerable distance between themselves\
    \ and the weapon's area of effect."
- name: "UT2003 Redeemer"
  description: "The first time you witness this miniature nuclear device in action,\
    \ you'll agree it is the most powerful weapon in the Tournament.|Launch a slow-moving\
    \ but utterly devastating missile with the primary fire; but make sure you're\
    \ out of the Redeemer's impressive blast radius before it impacts. The secondary\
    \ fire allows you to guide the nuke yourself with a rocket's-eye view.||Keep in\
    \ mind, however, that you are vulnerable to attack when steering the Redeemer's\
    \ projectile. Due to the extreme bulkiness of its ammo, the Redeemer is exhausted\
    \ after a single shot."
- name: "UT2003 Rocket Launcher"
  description: "The Trident Tri-barrel Rocket Launcher is extremely popular among\
    \ competitors who enjoy more bang for their buck.|The rotating rear loading barrel\
    \ design allows for both single- and multi-warhead launches, letting you place\
    \ up to three dumb fire rockets on target.|The warheads are designed to deliver\
    \ maximum concussive force to the target and surrounding area upon detonation."
- name: "UT2003 Shield Gun"
  description: "The Kemphler DD280 Riot Control Device has the ability to resist and\
    \ reflect incoming projectiles and energy beams. The plasma wave inflicts massive\
    \ damage, rupturing tissue, pulverizing organs, and flooding the bloodstream with\
    \ dangerous gas bubbles.||This weapon may be intended for combat at close range,\
    \ but when wielded properly should be considered as dangerous as any other armament\
    \ in your arsenal."
- name: "UT2003 Shock Rifle"
  description: "The ASMD Shock Rifle has changed little since its incorporation into\
    \ the Tournaments. The ASMD sports two firing modes capable of acting in concert\
    \ to neutralize opponents in a devastating shockwave.||This combination attack\
    \ is achieved when the weapon operator utilizes the secondary fire mode to deliver\
    \ a charge of seeded plasma to the target.|Once the slow-moving plasma charge\
    \ is within range of the target, the weapon operator may fire the photon beam\
    \ into the plasma core, releasing the explosive energy of the anti-photons contained\
    \ within the plasma's EM field."
- name: "UT2003 Lightning Gun"
  description: "The Lightning Gun is a high-power energy rifle capable of ablating\
    \ even the heaviest carapace armor. Acquisition of a target at long range requires\
    \ a steady hand, but the anti-jitter effect of the optical system reduces the\
    \ weapon's learning curve significantly. Once the target has been acquired, the\
    \ operator depresses the trigger, painting a proton 'patch' on the target. Milliseconds\
    \ later the rifle emits a high voltage arc of electricity, which seeks out the\
    \ charge differential and annihilates the target."
- name: "UT2003 Super Shock Rifle"
  description: "The ASMD Shock Rifle has changed little since its incorporation into\
    \ the Tournaments. The ASMD sports two firing modes capable of acting in concert\
    \ to neutralize opponents in a devastating shockwave.||This combination attack\
    \ is achieved when the weapon operator utilizes the secondary fire mode to deliver\
    \ a charge of seeded plasma to the target.|Once the slow-moving plasma charge\
    \ is within range of the target, the weapon operator may fire the photon beam\
    \ into the plasma core, releasing the explosive energy of the anti-photons contained\
    \ within the plasma's EM field."
- name: "UT2003 Translocator"
  description: "The Translocator was originally designed by Liandri Corporation's\
    \ R&D sector to facilitate the rapid recall of miners during tunnel collapses.\
    \ However, rapid deresolution and reconstitution can have several unwelcome effects,\
    \ including increases in aggression and paranoia.||In order to prolong the careers\
    \ of today's contenders, limits have been placed on Translocator use in the lower-ranked\
    \ leagues. The latest iteration of the Translocator features a remotely operated\
    \ camera, exceptionally useful when scouting out areas of contention.|It should\
    \ be noted that while viewing the camera's surveillance output, the user is effectively\
    \ blind to their immediate surroundings."
- name: "UT2003 Super Shock Rifle"
  description: "The ASMD Shock Rifle has changed little since its incorporation into\
    \ the Tournaments. The ASMD sports two firing modes capable of acting in concert\
    \ to neutralize opponents in a devastating shockwave.||This combination attack\
    \ is achieved when the weapon operator utilizes the secondary fire mode to deliver\
