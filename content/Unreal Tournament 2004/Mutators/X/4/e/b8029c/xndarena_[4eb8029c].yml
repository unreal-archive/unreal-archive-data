weapons:
- name: "Xnd Assault Rifle"
  description: "Xnd Modification; you can remote detonate the grenade by pressing\
    \ altfire again||Inexpensive and easily produced, the AR770 provides a lightweight\
    \ 5.56mm combat solution that is most effective against unarmored foes. With low-to-moderate\
    \ armor penetration capabilities, this rifle is best suited to a role as a light\
    \ support weapon.|The optional M355 Grenade Launcher provides the punch that makes\
    \ this weapon effective against heavily armored enemies.  Pick up a second assault\
    \ rifle to double your fire power."
- name: "Xnd Bio-Rifle"
  description: "Xnd Modification; faster projectiles||The GES BioRifle continues to\
    \ be one of the most controversial weapons in the Tournament. Loved by some, loathed\
    \ by others, the BioRifle has long been the subject of debate over its usefulness.||Some\
    \ Tournament purists argue that it is the equivalent of a cowardly minefield.\
    \ Others argue that it enhances the tactical capabilities of defensive combatants.|Despite\
    \ the debate, the weapon provides rapid-fire wide-area coverage in primary firing\
    \ mode, and a single-fire variable payload secondary firing mode. In layman's\
    \ terms, this equates to being able to pepper an area with small globs of Biosludge,\
    \ or launch one large glob at the target."
- name: "Xnd Flak Cannon"
  description: "Xnd Modification; boosted primary and toned down secondary||Trident\
    \ Defensive Technologies Series 7 Flechette Cannon has been taken to the next\
    \ step in evolution with the production of the Mk3 "
- name: "Xnd Link Gun"
  description: "Xnd Modification; secondary fire will attach to enemies leeching ammo,\
    \ primary following secondary will send seeking projectiles to tagged player||Riordan\
    \ Dynamic Weapon Systems combines the best of weapon design in the Advanced Plasma\
    \ Rifle v23, commonly known as the Link Gun.|While the primary firing mode of\
    \ the Link remains the same as its plasma-firing predecessor, the secondary cutting\
    \ torch has been replaced with a switchable energy matrix. Upon contacting a teammate,\
    \ it converts to a harmless carrier stream, offloading energy from the onboard\
    \ cells to boost the output of any targeted player also using the Link.|It should\
    \ be noted that while players are boosting a teammate, they are unable to defend\
    \ themselves from attack."
- name: "Xnd Minigun"
  description: "Xnd Modification; the longer you hold fire down the faster you shoot||The\
    \ Schultz-Metzger T23-A 23mm rotary cannon is capable of firing both high-velocity\
    \ caseless ammunition and cased rounds. With an unloaded weight of only 8 kilograms,\
    \ the T23 is portable and maneuverable, easily worn across the back when employing\
    \ the optional carrying strap.|The T23-A is the rotary cannon of choice for the\
    \ discerning soldier."
- name: "Xnd Rocket Launcher"
  description: "Xnd Modification; the rocket launcher has more splash and less damage||The\
    \ Trident Tri-barrel Rocket Launcher is extremely popular among competitors who\
    \ enjoy more bang for their buck.|The rotating rear loading barrel design allows\
    \ for both single- and multi-warhead launches, letting you place up to three dumb\
    \ fire rockets on target.|The warheads are designed to deliver maximum concussive\
    \ force to the target and surrounding area upon detonation."
- name: "Xnd Shock Rifle"
  description: "Xnd Modification; the secondary fire can now charge up to 4 projectiles\
    \ which release very rapidly when discharged||The ASMD Shock Rifle has changed\
    \ little since its incorporation into the Tournaments. The ASMD sports two firing\
    \ modes capable of acting in concert to neutralize opponents in a devastating\
    \ shockwave.||This combination attack is achieved when the weapon operator utilizes\
    \ the secondary fire mode to deliver a charge of seeded plasma to the target.|Once\
    \ the slow-moving plasma charge is within range of the target, the weapon operator\
    \ may fire the photon beam into the plasma core, releasing the explosive energy\
    \ of the anti-photons contained within the plasma's EM field."
