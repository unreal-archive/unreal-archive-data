weapons:
- name: "GES Bio Rifle"
  description: "Classification: Toxic RiflennPrimary Fire: Wads of Tarydium byproduct\
    \ are lobbed at a medium rate of fire.nnSecondary Fire: When trigger is held down,\
    \ the BioRifle will create a much larger wad of byproduct. When this wad is launched,\
    \ it will burst into smaller wads which will adhere to any surfaces.nnTechniques:\
    \ Byproducts will adhere to walls, floors, or ceilings. Chain reactions can be\
    \ caused by covering entryways with this lethal green waste."
- name: "UT Flak Cannon"
  description: "Classification: Heavy ShrapnelnnPrimary Fire: White hot chunks of\
    \ scrap metal are sprayed forth, shotgun style.nnSecondary Fire: A grenade full\
    \ of shrapnel is lobbed at the enemy.nnTechniques: The Flak Cannon is far more\
    \ useful in close range combat situations."
- name: "Pulse Gun"
  description: "Classification: Plasma RiflennPrimary Fire: Medium sized, fast moving\
    \ plasma balls are fired at a fast rate of fire.nnSecondary Fire: A bolt of green\
    \ lightning is expelled for 100 meters, which will shock all opponents.nnTechniques:\
    \ Firing and keeping the secondary fire's lightning on an opponent will melt them\
    \ in seconds."
- name: "UT Minigun"
  description: "Classification: Gatling GunnnPrimary Fire: Bullets are sprayed forth\
    \ at a medium to fast rate of fire and good accuracy.nnSecondary Fire: Minigun\
    \ fires twice as fast and is half as accurate.nnTechniques: Secondary fire is\
    \ much more useful at close range, but can eat up tons of ammunition."
- name: "UT Rocketlauncher"
  description: "Classification: Heavy BallisticnnPrimary Fire: Slow moving but deadly\
    \ rockets are fired at opponents. Trigger can be held down to load up to six rockets\
    \ at a time, which can be fired at once.nnSecondary Fire: Grenades are lobbed\
    \ from the barrel. Secondary trigger can be held as well to load up to six grenades.nnTechniques:\
    \ Keeping this weapon pointed at an opponent will cause it to lock on, and while\
    \ the gun is locked the next rocket fired will be a homing rocket.  Because the\
    \ Rocket Launcher can load up multiple rockets, it fires when you release the\
    \ fire button.  If you prefer, it can be configured to fire a rocket as soon as\
    \ you press fire button down, at the expense of the multiple rocket load-up feature.\
    \  This is set in the Input Options menu."
- name: "ASMD Shock Rifle"
  description: "Energy RiflennPrimary Fire: Instant hit laser beam.nnSecondary Fire:\
    \ Large, slow moving plasma balls.nnTechniques: Hitting the secondary fire plasma\
    \ balls with the regular fire's laser beam will cause an immensely powerful explosion."
- name: "Impact Hammer (UT)"
  description: "Melee Piston Primary Fire: When trigger is held down, touch opponents\
    \ with this piston to inflict massive damage. Secondary Fire: Damages opponents\
    \ at close range and has the ability to deflect projectiles. Techniques: Shoot\
    \ at the ground while jumping to jump extra high."
- name: "Ripjack"
  description: "Liandri's continued failure to deliver an updated replacement for\
    \ the beloved Ripper has led an independant weapons developer to take up the gauntlet.\
    \ The weapons and munitions division of R.A.D. Technologies has most certainly\
    \ delivered the goods. Featuring a sleek new look combined with deadly destructive\
    \ capabilites, the MkII Ripjack is a lethal weapon to be faced with. Get too cocky\
    \ and you could easily lose your head. Twitch your trigger finger at just the\
    \ wrong moment and you could just as easily shred yourself with an explosive razor.\
    \ Utmost caution is advised both while wielding the weapon and facing a competent\
    \ opponent wielding it."
- name: "Enforcer"
  description: "Classification: Light PistolnnPrimary Fire: Accurate but slow firing\
    \ instant hit.nnSecondary Fire: Sideways, or 'Gangsta' firing mode, shoots twice\
    \ as fast and half as accurate as the primary fire.nnTechniques: Collect two for\
    \ twice the damage."

    \ bullet. Can kill instantly when applied to the cranium of opposing forces. nnSecondary\
    \ Fire: Zooms the rifle in, up to eight times normal vision. Allows for extreme\
    \ precision from hundreds of yards away.nnTechniques: Great for long distance\
    \ headshots!"
