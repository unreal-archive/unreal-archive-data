  description: "The Heavy Assault Combat Rifle-500rpm Series or HACR-500 (HACkeR)\
    \ for short, is a heavier alterantive to the standard AR-770 series assault rifle.\
    \  Although it fires the larger 7.62 round with a larger recoil, its enhanced\
    \ barrel and firing mechanism allows for overall more accurate shots than its\
    \ predecessor.  Its most unique triat however, is its ability to automatically\
    \ switch over to a 3-round-burst firemode whenever the user utilizes its zoom\
    \ feature."
