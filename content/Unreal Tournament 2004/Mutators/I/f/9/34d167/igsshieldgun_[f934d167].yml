  description: "The [IGS]ShieldGun has the ability to resist and reflect incoming\
    \ projectiles and energy beams. The plasma wave inflicts massive damage, rupturing\
    \ tissue, pulverizing organs, and flooding the bloodstream with dangerous gas\
    \ bubbles.||This weapon may be intended for combat at close range, but when wielded\
    \ properly should be considered as dangerous as any other armament in your arsenal."
