- name: "Arkon Weapons 2004"
  description: "Arkon2004 - Arkon's Revenge||Replaces all standard weapons with the\
    \ new guns from the Arkon Weapons pack."
weapons:
- name: "Missile Launcher"
  description: "A sturdy, solid case bottom-loader that fires a calibre 10, self propelled\
    \ projectile, featuring an armor piercing high explosive warhead of considerable\
    \ size that is capable of stopping small-to-medium sized armored vehicles and\
    \ unleashes a devastating effect if fired at soft targets. Designed as a single-carried\
    \ light support weapon, this missile launcher was meant to combat agile enemies\
    \ at medium distances, so it was outfitted with a laserlock type foefinder unit\
    \ to ensure a precise targeting."
- name: "Combat Mortar"
  description: "Latest development in the heavy-assault gear department. The mortar\
    \ grenade will upon impact discharge a highly energetic field that is both lethal\
    \ and at the same time has the extraordinary ability to short out most known shielding\
    \ devices by disrupting the base projector matrix. This will cause uncontrollable\
    \ and dangerous fluctuations in the shield's power supply and will take at least\
    \ a few seconds time for the victim to re-initialize the matrix. If fired at at\
    \ soft target closer than ten feet though, at the speed it is fired with the grenade\
    \ is likely to actually penetrate the victim's defences and after a check-back\
    \ via the built in distance tracer will then unleash all the stored power into\
    \ this target exclusively instead of emitting it in all directions. Combined with\
    \ the considerable kinetic force the projectile holds, the Combat Mortar indeed\
    \ makes also for a quite formidable close combat weapon."
- name: "Desintegrator Grenade"
  description: "Widely known as 'Moluk Raybomb' the light type-D assault ammunition\
    \ is appreciated as a versatile and powerful hand grenade. Based on the same idea\
    \ as the desintegrator rifle, the desintegrator grenade incites a spontaneous\
    \ breakdown of all molecular cohaesive forces in a ten feet radius, though it's\
    \ effectivity quickly diminishes over distance."
- name: "Desintegrator"
  description: "The Desintegrator is a device both widely used as a weapon as well\
    \ as a mining tool, focusing a flirring, greenish field that is capable of interfering\
    \ with the targets cohaesive forces on a molecular level. Matter with extremely\
    \ high density will sustain longer, still even the hardest stone can be rendered\
    \ to ultra-fine dust in a matter of seconds. Gases principally seem unaffected,\
    \ since their cohaesive forces are already very low. A living being struck by\
    \ a desintegrator ray will usually dissolve and die instantly, but since most\
    \ tournament combatants have undergone various degrees of biomechanical enhancement\
    \ a few extra hits can never hurt..."
- name: "Disruptor"
  description: "Core of this unique weapon is a micro-polaron anticycler, a complex\
    \ device capable of hyperenergizing matter with low molecular density. Although\
    \ theoretically any inert gas could be used to power the gun, best results have\
    \ been observed using Tetrahelium, which is better known as 'Tetron', a common\
    \ fuel substance used for small starship reactors. The Disruptor itself features\
    \ two fire modes: primary launches a deadly, highly focused proton-energy torpedo\
    \ that remains coherent even over large distances, while secondary unleashes the\
    \ Disruptor's full destructive power by simply releasing the energized plasma\
    \ in a super-hot, yet short ranged, burst of eerie green flames."
- name: "Fusion-Gatling Gun"
  description: "Using ancient technology found in derelict planetary defence cannons\
    \ this miniaturized portable fusion cannon is still easily capable of bringing\
    \ down medium sized aircraft. It's impressive size and bulkiness can severly hinder\
    \ your movement in actual combat. Since technicians also saw no way to implement\
    \ a sufficient coolant reservoir without making it imposible for a single humanoid\
    \ to carry, the weapon's design was instead based on outdated gatling guns, featuring\
    \ a spinning set of several barrels to prevent overheating of the focus unit,\
    \ which adds another severe drawback, namely a four second spin-up delay to precisely\
    \ synchronize the barrel rotation with the singularity's hypertact before the\
    \ gun can be used."
- name: "LaserBomb"
  description: "An outdated, clumsy makeshift weapon of considerable destructive force\
    \ nevertheless. A standard set of three ground-to-ground missile fuel units, outfitted\
    \ with a simple electronic lightbarrier trigger to set off a devastating explosion\
    \ the moment somthing breaks through the laser. Most useful if stuck against a\
    \ wall in a doorway or tight corridor to ensure the target is within blast range.\
    \ Can be easily disabled/detonated with most weapons by hitting it fom a safe\
    \ distance though. The non-intelligent trigger mechanism makes it dangerous to\
    \ friends and foes alike, so handle with extreme care."
- name: "MassDriver"
  description: "The Kappa labs - Mark II infantry carried mass driver represents the\
    \ pinnacle of terran weapons technology. This state of the art magnetic mass-accellerator\
    \ weapon fires an ultra cooled Terkonit cylinder projectile at some three digit\
    \ multiplier the speed of sound, which allows passing through most solid objects\
    \ with ease. Even the most advanced shielding technologies are hardly able to\
    \ resist such a tremendous kinetic energy and will most likely only slow it down\
    \ to the point a conventional armor might stand a chance, even then, victims are\
    \ usually hurt considerably and thrown back great distances. Headshots are always\
    \ lethal though, no questions asked."
- name: "Orbital Cannon Uplink"
  description: "This inconspicuous little electronic device allows the combatant to\
    \ establish an uplink with the extremely potent stellar converter satellite currently\
    \ orbiting roughly thirty-thousand kilometers above the battlefield. Upon successful\
    \ marking of the attack location and a short delay to charge the capacitors and\
    \ bring the satellite in precise firing position, a highly focused stream of intense\
    \ thermal energy will strike the target and unleash hell on earth for a duration\
    \ of approximately ten seconds, completely wiping out any resistance in near vicinity."
- name: "Plasma Gun"
  description: "A 'pulse driver' is based on the cold fusion principle and usually\
    \ only encountered in form of an impulse drive inside a full sized starship, but\
    \ recently a number of prototype handheld weapons featuring a nuclear pulse generator\
    \ have also appeared. Catalytic Deuterium is used as nuclear reactive mass, the\
    \ created fusion plasma is then contained and accellerated through a tubular magnetic\
    \ field with gravomechanical properies. The amount of plasma per shot can be dynamically\
    \ adjusted by pressing and holding down the charge-button, but is severely limited,\
    \ compared to a ship-mounted device, by the technical weakness of the small containment\
    \ chamber. Safety precautions prohibit charging up more than twenty-five PJ [petajoule]\
    \ as this is already creating impressive and very dangerous inductory effects.\
    \ Projectiles usually glow in an eerie blue and are capable of melting effortlessly\
    \ through five-inch plates of solid Terkonit."
- name: "Thermo Grenade"
  description: "From a technical point of view the desintegrator grenade might be\
    \ cleaner, more aestaethic and a helluva' lot safer to handle, but there's no\
    \ point in being hypocritical if atomization in a desintegrator field or vaporization\
    \ in a controlled sub-nuclear heat wave is the more humane method of killing.\
    \ And holding the power of a 'Pocket-Nova', as the thermo grenade has been respectfully\
    \ titulated frequently, in your hand feels extremely satisfying."
- name: "Thermo Blasters"
  description: "The basic carbon laser pistol issued to military and security personal\
    \ all over the galaxy. Small, lightweight, dependable and at the same time dealing\
    \ out damage like no other, once you got two of them..."
- name: "Thermal Projector"
  description: "The CNC or, scientifically correct, 'Constant-Rip Needlepoint Cannon',\
    \ is combining two completely different physical principles into an entirely new\
    \ weapon: an ordinary high-power infrared carbon laser is fired through a tubular\
    \ energy field with hyperphysical characteristics, that completely prevents the\
    \ beam to suffer any losses, be it optical or thermical diasperation. Not only\
    \ is it possible this way to keep the beam focused even over long distances, but\
    \ the surrounding air also wont heat up."
