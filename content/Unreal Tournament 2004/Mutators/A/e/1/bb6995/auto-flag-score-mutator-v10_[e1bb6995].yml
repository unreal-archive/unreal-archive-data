description: "This mutator allows flag carriers to score, even if their flag isn't\
  \ in their base.  It works for both CTF and VCTF gametypes.  You can choose several\
  \ options:  - Custom dropped flag timeout, before it's sent home. - Auto flag return\
  \ when you score, if both flags are held. - Kill enemy flag carrier if you score\
  \ first, and death type. - Ion cannon blast visual effect, when this happens. -\
  \ A hovering ghost miniflag will appear over your empty flag base, to show you that\
  \ you can score even if your flag isn't there. - Some HUD messages will tell you\
  \ that auto score is on, as well. - When you have the enemy flag, touch your flag\
  \ base, and  even if your flag is taken, you will score just as if you flag was\
  \ there. You don't have to worry if the enemy has your flag, because the flag doesn't\
  \ need to be returned to score. - If Auto Return is set (see below for configuration\
  \ / ini file), then your flag will be returned, too. - When enemy flag carrier kill\
  \ is on, if both teams have taken the other team's flag (both flags held), who touches\
  \ the flag base first will score, while the other will be killed."
