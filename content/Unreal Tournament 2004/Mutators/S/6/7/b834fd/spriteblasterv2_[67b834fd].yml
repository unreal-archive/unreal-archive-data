  description: "Formerly known as the 'Flarebolt Cannon', the 'Sprite Blaster' features\
    \ a modified firing mode as well as improvements to its alt-fire sequence.  Using\
    \ canisters of unstable ionized plasma, its main fire mode sends out multiple\
    \ arcs of super-heated electro-plasma that will incinerate anything within its\
    \ limited range.  Like the previous model, its alt-fire deploys a miniature sun-like\
    \ projectile that will zap anything within a certain radius of said projectile.\
    \  The name of this weapon derives from the weather phenomenon seen above active\
    \ thunderstorms."
