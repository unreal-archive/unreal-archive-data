    \ reflect incoming projectiles and energy beams. The plasma wave inflicts massive\
    \ damage, rupturing tissue, pulverizing organs, and flooding the bloodstream with\
    \ dangerous gas bubbles.||This weapon may be intended for combat at close range,\
    \ but when wielded properly should be considered as dangerous as any other armament\
    \ in your arsenal."
