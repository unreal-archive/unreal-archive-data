  description: "The Super Weapons Super Shock Rifle is back, and it still packs a\
    \ punch under the right hands. It can chain-combo alt-fire projectiles to end\
    \ up with a bigger beam after every one, up to 5 times as big. When at its maximum\
    \ size, and when it hits a wall, the resultant explosion gives off an ion cannon\
    \ type of explosion, with deadly consequences. But this requires time, skill,\
    \ and ammo, as the resultant  beam drains ammo fast, up to 20 ammo for the linking."
