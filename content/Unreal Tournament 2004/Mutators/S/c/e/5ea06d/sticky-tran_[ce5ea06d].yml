  description: "The Sticky Translocator was originally designed by Liandri Corporation's\
    \ R&D sector to facilitate the rapid recall of miners during tunnel collapses.\
    \ However, rapid deresolution and reconstitution can have several unwelcome effects,\
    \ including increases in aggression and paranoia.||In order to prolong the careers\
    \ of today's contenders, limits have been placed on Translocator use in the lower-ranked\
    \ leagues. The latest iteration of the Translocator features a remotely operated\
    \ camera, exceptionally useful when scouting out areas of contention.|It should\
    \ be noted that while viewing the camera's surveillance output, the user is effectively\
    \ blind to their immediate surroundings."
