weapons:
- name: "Assault Rifle"
  description: "UAR-42 Ultor Military Assault Rifle|This weapon is designed to offer\
    \ all the benefits of a full-length rifle in a compact design. It is capable of\
    \ firing three-round bursts or full automatic fire. Compared to fully automatic\
    \ fire, three-round bursts offer increased control and aim but potentially decreased\
    \ force, unless fired at close range. The high-velocity armor-piercing shells\
    \ inflict massive damage on unarmed targets and will penetrate body armor easily.\
    \ This is the standard rifle issued to Ultor soldiers."
- name: "Remote Charge"
  description: "URC-15 Ultor Remote Mining Charge|This is a medium-sized, high-explosive\
    \ remotely detonated charge. They are effective against unarmored and armored\
    \ personnel as well as light vehicles."
- name: "Rocket Launcher"
  description: "URL-6T Ultor Tactical Rocket Launcher|Primary Fire: Fires 'dumb' rockets,\
    \ automatically fires a rocket every 1,80 seconds."
- name: "NewYear Machine Gun"
  description: "UAP-32/20 Ultor Submachine Gun|This weapon is slightly larger than\
    \ the handgun and is capable of full automatic fire. Heavier than the handgun,\
    \ the machine pistol offers better control in full auto mode, though it remains\
    \ inaccurate at medium or long range."
