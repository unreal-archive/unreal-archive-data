  description: "The most wanted serial killer in the history of mankind was Damon\
    \ Adamus - a genius and madman who surgically modified his own body to become\
    \ a half machine monstrosity. |Using a selfmade stealth-device he traveled the\
    \ outer colony planets, killing 2222 colonists - eating several of those colonists\
    \ he was called the 'ManEater'. After finishing his 'work' without being caught\
    \ a single time he decided to end his life fighting - infiltrating a spacemarine\
    \ outpost on MT-803 he died together with 46 marines. |However, the weapon he\
    \ invented - the ManHack - was quickly copied by the Liandri Corp for use in the\
    \ Tournament."
