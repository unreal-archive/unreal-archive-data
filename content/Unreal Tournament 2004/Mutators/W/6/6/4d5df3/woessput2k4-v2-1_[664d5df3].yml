- name: "WOESentinel-Systemic MultiPickup"
  description: "Meant to be used with both MrEvil's 'Weapons of Evil: Sentinel' mutator\
    \ and the 'Systemic Pickup UT2K4' mech mutator. It alters the Shield, MegaShield,\
    \ MegaHealth and UDamage pickup bases, so that these standard pickup types alternate\
    \ every 30 seconds and include sentinel and mech pickups as well. NOTE: Large\
    \ crate replacement should be disabled in the 'Weapons of Evil: Sentinel' mutator."
- name: "WOESentinel-Systemic Avril"
  description: "Allows the Avril to also target the player placed sentinels from MrEvil's\
    \ 'Weapons Of Evil: Sentinel' mutator, and the player controlled mechs from the\
    \ 'Systemic Pickup UT2K4' mutator. This mutator is designed to be used in conjunction\
    \ with them."
- name: "Systemic Pickup UT2K4"
  description: "Allows for adding large controllable mechs, or 'Cygen' to the gametypes\
    \ of Unreal Tournament 2004. This is a seperate port of the original Systemic\
    \ mutator for UT2003 with the mechs now spawned as pickups. *It requires the 'WOESentinel-Systemic\
    \ MultiPickup' mutator loaded for it to work*."

    \ both high-velocity caseless ammunition and cased rounds. With an unloaded weight\
    \ of only 8 kilograms, the T23 is portable and maneuverable, easily worn across\
    \ the back when employing the optional carrying strap.|The T23-A is the rotary\
    \ cannon of choice for the discerning soldier."

    \ competitors who enjoy more bang for their buck.|The rotating rear loading barrel\
    \ design allows for both single- and multi-warhead launches, letting you place\
    \ up to three dumb fire rockets on target.|The warheads are designed to deliver\
    \ maximum concussive force to the target and surrounding area upon detonation."
