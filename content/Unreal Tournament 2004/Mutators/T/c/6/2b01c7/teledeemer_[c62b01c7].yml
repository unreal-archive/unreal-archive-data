  description: "The first time you witness this miniature nuclear device in action,\
    \ you'll agree it is the most powerful weapon in the Tournament.|Launch a slow-moving\
    \ but utterly devastating missile with the primary fire; but make sure you're\
    \ out of the Redeemer's impressive blast radius before it impacts. The secondary\
    \ fire allows you to guide the nuke yourself with a rocket's-eye view.||Keep in\
    \ mind, however, that you are vulnerable to attack when steering the Redeemer's\
    \ projectile. Due to the extreme bulkiness of its ammo, the Redeemer is exhausted\
    \ after a single shot."
