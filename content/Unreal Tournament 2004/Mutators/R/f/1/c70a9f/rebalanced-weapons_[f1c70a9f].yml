weapons:
- name: "Rebalanced Assault Rifle"
  description: "Inexpensive and easily produced, the AR770 provides a lightweight\
    \ 5.56mm combat solution that is most effective against unarmored foes. With low-to-moderate\
    \ armor penetration capabilities, this rifle is best suited to a role as a light\
    \ support weapon.|The optional M355 Grenade Launcher provides the punch that makes\
    \ this weapon effective against heavily armored enemies.  Pick up a second assault\
    \ rifle to double your fire power."
- name: "Rebalanced Bio-Rifle"
  description: "The GES BioRifle continues to be one of the most controversial weapons\
    \ in the Tournament. Loved by some, loathed by others, the BioRifle has long been\
    \ the subject of debate over its usefulness.||Some Tournament purists argue that\
    \ it is the equivalent of a cowardly minefield. Others argue that it enhances\
    \ the tactical capabilities of defensive combatants.|Despite the debate, the weapon\
    \ provides rapid-fire wide-area coverage in primary firing mode, and a single-fire\
    \ variable payload secondary firing mode. In layman's terms, this equates to being\
    \ able to pepper an area with small globs of Biosludge, or launch one large glob\
    \ at the target."
- name: "Rebalanced Minigun"
  description: "The Schultz-Metzger T23-A 23mm rotary cannon is capable of firing\
    \ both high-velocity caseless ammunition and cased rounds. With an unloaded weight\
    \ of only 8 kilograms, the T23 is portable and maneuverable, easily worn across\
    \ the back when employing the optional carrying strap.|The T23-A is the rotary\
    \ cannon of choice for the discerning soldier."
- name: "Rebalanced Shock Rifle"
  description: "The ASMD Shock Rifle has changed little since its incorporation into\
    \ the Tournaments. The ASMD sports two firing modes capable of acting in concert\
    \ to neutralize opponents in a devastating shockwave.||This combination attack\
    \ is achieved when the weapon operator utilizes the secondary fire mode to deliver\
    \ a charge of seeded plasma to the target.|Once the slow-moving plasma charge\
    \ is within range of the target, the weapon operator may fire the photon beam\
    \ into the plasma core, releasing the explosive energy of the anti-photons contained\
    \ within the plasma's EM field."
