  description: "The Lightning Gun is a high-power energy rifle capable of ablating\
    \ even the heaviest carapace armor. Acquisition of a target at long range requires\
    \ a steady hand, but the anti-jitter effect of the optical system reduces the\
    \ weapon's learning curve significantly. Once the target has been acquired, the\
    \ operator depresses the trigger, painting a proton 'patch' on the target. Milliseconds\
    \ later the rifle emits a high voltage arc of electricity, which seeks out the\
    \ charge differential and annihilates the target."

    \ in mind, however, that you are vulnerable to attack when steering the Redeemer's\
