description: "Set on the dried outskirts of a lush jungle continent, two factions\
  \ clash in fierce combat for control of a major communications tower and its adjacent\
  \ power supply. With the dam holding back the waters from the nearby jungle, the\
  \ dried out riverbed running across the battlefield allows for an easy attack route\
  \ into enemy territory and could provide a decisive victor with ownership of the\
  \ enormous Comm-tower as the reward."
