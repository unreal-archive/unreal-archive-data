description: "Thanks to all }TCP{ PLP and others that helped me edit this map. I was\
  \ stuck in corners and Carnage, Kobra and many others, helped me to get this level\
  \ this far. There may be some bugs left here, so if you find one, please tell me\
  \ and I will do my best to fix them. And special thanks also goes to Carnage again,\
  \ for giving me a place on his server. Special thanks to Krabbelricher for all of\
  \ his tips and hints."
