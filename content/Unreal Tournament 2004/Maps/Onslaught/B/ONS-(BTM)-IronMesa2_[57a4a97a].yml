description: "The experimental creation of a city in the desert fell through the scientists\
  \ hands like sand through the fingers. Everything was thought of, minus one thing.\
  \ Weather. The Hot box would produce no rain and much growth was stunted. The humid\
  \ hell hole is now the epic cornerstone of multi-level battle field crusades. Crushing\
  \ your enemy WILL take more than the default time. We recommend rounds of 30-45\
  \ minutes. The map has been revamped in version II"
