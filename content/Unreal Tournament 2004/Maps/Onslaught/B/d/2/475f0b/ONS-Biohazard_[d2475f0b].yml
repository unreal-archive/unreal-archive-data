description: "This relic of the scientific past had been abandoned for decades before\
  \ being rediscovered by a commercial scout, charting the vast reaches of space.\

  \ rival corporations have landed mercenary armies within the biodome in an attempt\
  \ to seize control, and begin unlocking the secrets of this contained world."
