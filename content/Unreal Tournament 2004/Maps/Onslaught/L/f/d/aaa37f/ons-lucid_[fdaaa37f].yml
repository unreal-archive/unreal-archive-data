description: "Gold was once the most prized possession for any important person on\
  \ Earth. Battles have been fought and wars have been waged to possess as much gold\
  \ as possible. But that was ages ago. Now precious minerals known as Khristahls\
  \ rule the material market. Recently a large quantity of these minerals have been\
  \ found near a river of bio-acid and your team is not the only one hunting for these\
  \ Khristahls. Sharing is for innocent little boys, but who's still innocent these\
  \ days?"
