description: "Deep-space exploration has revealed a phenomenon never before observed-a\
  \ planetary system with NO sun. Infra-Red light reacting with carbon dioxide in\
  \ the high atmosphere bathes the planet in a searing, blood-red glow. Experiments\
  \ have shown that more than 18 hours on this planet will cause irreversible insanity.\
  \ You won't live that long..."
