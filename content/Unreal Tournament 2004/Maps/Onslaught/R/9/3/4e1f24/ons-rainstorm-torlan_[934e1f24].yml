description: "Set on the dried outskirts of a lush jungle continent, two factions\
  \ clash in fierce combat for control of a major communications tower and its adjacent\
  \ power supply. With the dam holding back the waters from the nearby jungle, the\
  \ dried out riverbed running across the battlefield allows for an easy attack route\
  \ into enemy territory and could provide a decisive victor with ownership of the\
  \ enormous Comm-tower as the reward.  In the beginning I only wanted to learn the\
  \ new Editor, because I'll shift all mapping activities from UT2004 to UT3. So I\
  \ started to sample something I know good and took ONS-Torlan, the best retail UT2004\
  \ ONS map, to gain some practice with the new Editor."
