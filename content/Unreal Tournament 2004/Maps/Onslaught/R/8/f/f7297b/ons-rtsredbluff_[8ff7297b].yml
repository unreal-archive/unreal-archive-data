description: "This use to be a peaceful place,explained Jeb, the old prospector. The\
  \ townfolk,here in Red Bluff,lived in harmony with the Chipawha Indians and their\
  \ neighbors of Dry Gulch. But John (The Skunk) Walker destroyed this peace by taking\
  \ over the town of Dry Gulch and hogging all the water for himself. This caused\
  \ a ruckus between the two towns because old Walker made it look like the people\
  \ of Dry Gulch were getting greedy. The Chipawha now no longer trusted any of us\
  \ pale faces,So the peaceful life that once was is no longer."
