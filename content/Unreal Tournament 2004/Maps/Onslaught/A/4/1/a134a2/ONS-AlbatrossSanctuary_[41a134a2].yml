description: "A once lush green valley was home to the Giant Albatross and there worshipers.\
  \  The Makai were a proud and peaceful people but war fell upon them and their valley\
  \ was ravaged and their revered bird flew the coop.  The grasses have begun to return\
  \ but there is no sign of the Albatross or its worshipers."
