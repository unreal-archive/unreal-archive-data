description: "Deep in the heart of the Ocean of Dunes, a small oasis of civilization\
  \ welcomes the weary traveler. Any who step through the gates of the Temple of Aswan\
  \ are welcome, though none may leave without taking part in the trials. The Anubans\
  \ have used the trials as a means to test their prospective competitors for hundreds\
  \ of years. Success means fame and glory, failure means the scavengers pick the\
  \ meat from your bones. Are you really that thirsty?"
