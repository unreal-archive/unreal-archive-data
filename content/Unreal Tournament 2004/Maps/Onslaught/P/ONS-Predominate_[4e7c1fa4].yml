description: "Tuck Johnson and his crew had searched across the galaxy for the forgotten\
  \ planet of Petalina, hoping to find clues of life. However, their first glimpse\
  \ showed Petalina to be a dead planet orbiting a nearly dead and lightless sun.\
  \ Just as they prepared their ship to leave the backwater galaxy, one of the crew\
  \ found readings of plant life on a small island in the midst of a vast vocano.\
  \ Where the water had flooded all around the island cutting it off. Through some\
  \ atmospheric phenomena, the island was somehow able to maintain just enough oxygen\
  \ within its mountain ranges to support some mutated plants and very small squirrel-like\
  \ creatures. Tuck and his crew immediately set down and began construction of a\
  \ vast transparant force field dome to both contain the oxygen and to magnify what\
  \ light still escaped from Petalina's sun. Aiming the suns rays to the top of the\
  \ dome, helping the plant life to flourish. A dam was built to provide hydroelectric\
  \ power to the dome. Amidst the construction, one of the crewmembers uncovered an\
  \ ancient temple that seemed to provide clues to the location of Old Earth. Foolishly,\
  \ he sent a message across the hyperwaves to his university professor, trying to\
  \ decipher the writings. When Tuck realized what had happened, he quickly mobilized\
  \ the base for possible pirate attacks, knowing that even the possibility of finding\
  \ Old Earth would be worth a fortune...."
