description: "The Jungle Hill arena is situated on the planet Hathor IV. Formly a\
  \ weapons test site, the climate of the planet altered drastically when average\
  \ temperatures increased due to extreme atmoshperic pollution. Now, as the equatorial\
  \ regoins become desert, the poles of Hathor IV are being overgrown with dense tropical\
  \ vegetaion. Invariably, the jungles have encroached on the remains of an old castle\
  \ complex, making for a unique atmosphere. Recently purchased by the Tournament\
  \ Sponsors, Hathor IV has found new life as the location for the exciting Jungle\
  \ Hill Onslaught Arena."
