description: "Two teams, two ships, one valley...||Onslaught conversion by GreatEmerald||Two\
  \ scout ships - Skaarj and NEG - had crashed on Na Pali because of the gravitational\
  \ force none of them knew of. They had to gain control over the Tarydium pools in\
  \ the valley to power their own ships while trying to ruin the plans of the enemies,\
  \ even to the point of destroying their ship engine. This year the Liandri Corporation\
  \ decided to recreate this battle in an Onslaught environment."
