description: "Faunus was an uninhabited planet when a fleeing group of primitives\
  \ from a neighboring planet landed in the thickest forest. The race was fleeing\
  \ enslavement by a far more advanced race, the Necris. Thinking they were safe in\
  \ the dense wild of Faunus, the beings began development of a village, but they\
  \ were quite mistaken. The race was captured and the small village was abandoned.\
  \ Liandri Corp. discovered the attempt at civilization and saw its potential for\
  \ a new battlefield for its on going tournament. Now the area provides a challenging\
  \ arena for champions to fight."
