  \ explored countless galaxies within a universe of billions of stars.  Unknown at\
  \ the time, the space portal travel corrupted human DNA resulting in a super-human\
  \ race with increased aggression and shameless disregard for human life.  The super-humans\
  \ dedicated their contentious lives to travelling through the web of space portals,\
  \ destroying other worlds.  Deep within the Magellanic Cloud your battle to survive\
  \ now begins.  Welcome to the planet SandStone."
