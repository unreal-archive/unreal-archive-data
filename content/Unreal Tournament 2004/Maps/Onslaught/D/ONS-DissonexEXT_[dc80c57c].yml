description: "e\fIn the interstellar third world, far from the reach of universal\
  \ authorities, there is a planet, Dissonex.  A once lush planet known the galaxy\
  \ over for its beautiful flora and fauna.  It rivaled the most scenic worlds in\
  \ the quadrant.  That was before the Galactic oilers came.  Finding a wealth of\
  \ deposits on dissonex, oilers built up large refineries and oil extractors across\
  \ the globe.  Paradise suffered, but business was booming. 150 years have past and\

  \ quarrelled and fought over rights to reserves that are now becoming more and more\
  \ scarce.  Refineries 1134A and B are 2 of the only facilities still functioning\
  \ at peak extraction levels, and now due to the evacuation of GLV Inc. no one has\
  \ claim to it.  Yet..."
