description: "Set among the crumbling ruins of the last Nali fortress, these icefields\
  \ were the final stand of the Nali against the Skaarj. Driving their Stone Giants\
  \ before them, the Skaarj lay siege to the city for three weeks, at last breaking\
  \ down the perimeter wall and wiping out all within for their effrontery. Now an\
  \ arena of Onslaught, the vast range of this location will test the teamwork and\
  \ focus of the very best."
