description: "They came in hard and fast, ruthlessly destroying everything in their\
  \ wake. To the Skaarj, it was just another planet to conquer. To the Gen Mo'Kai,\
  \ it was their home, their most sacred of places. The Skaarj tore through the rain-soaked\
  \ canyons and deep chasms, levelling all they could find. The Gen Mo'Kai fought\
  \ back bravely, but the Skaarj invaders outnumbered them with their battlecrafts\
  \ and their superior firepower. For every one of the reptilian foes who were slain,\
  \ another three took their place. The Gen Mo'Kai were close to defeat, when word\
  \ of their plight reached the outside worlds. Soon, combatants from far and wide\
  \ were travelling to the planet to take sides in this forgotten conflict. Soon,\
  \ the planet became a focus for the Unreal Tournaments, and the deadly battle has\
  \ continued through the ages, in a constant state of deadlock. There is no longer\
  \ good, nor evil. Just eternal war."
