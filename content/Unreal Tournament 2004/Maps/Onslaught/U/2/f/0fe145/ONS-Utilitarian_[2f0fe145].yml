description: "The life history of the Gentoki Corp Hydroelectric Facility is a tale\
  \ of transition.  Forced to shut down power production in early 2290 due to mudslides\
  \ caused by tectonic activity it quickly converted operations and equipment and\
  \ began filtering the local water supply for a large bottled water retailer.  When\
  \ the aquifer was polluted by fallout from the radioactive Kyanka/Parsons meteor\
  \ showers of 2300, the plant was sold to a large North American entertainment conglomerate.\
  \  It now serves a duel-function existence.  In the warm, dry season the rusty pipes,\
  \ concrete, and surrounding woodlands are used for the Tournament as an Onslaught\
  \ arena.  During the cold months when the surrounding lake floods the valley then\
  \ freezes nearly solid it serves as a massive ice-skating rink for tourists."
