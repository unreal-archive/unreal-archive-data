description: "Once the pinnacle of modernized civilization, this dense urban center\
  \ has since fallen victim to crime, corruption, and civil war. Now mostly vacant,\
  \ it has become a haven for underground criminal activity and lawlessness. LMC organizers\
  \ jumped at the opportunity to own this prime piece of real estate. Instead of leveling\
  \ the area and constructing a new arena, they decided to let the combatants to the\
  \ demolition work themselves."
