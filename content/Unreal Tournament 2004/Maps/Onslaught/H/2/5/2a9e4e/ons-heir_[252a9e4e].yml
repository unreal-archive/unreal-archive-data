description: "The smell of diesel exhaust fills your head and the pounding metallic\
  \ sound of engines and weapons invades your mind. Far above, the flying fighters\
  \ manoeuvre tediously, like caged birds. Long-time companions scramble through crowded\
  \ corridors to load up on guns. The fight is about to begin. An heir will soon be\
  \ found for a long dynasty of champions.||Can there be more to life?"
