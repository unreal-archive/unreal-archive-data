description: "Floating miles above the Earth, the mechanical gravity research facility,\
  \ Omega 1, lies abandon. Until now. The popularity of 'Face' prompted the Tournament\
  \ organizers to snatch this perfect carnage ground and trust it back into a safer\
  \ orbit. Unfortunatly, Omega 1 has been hurled into a sidelong spin. Those who watched\
  \ the Onslaught Tournaments held here on Holovison complained of extream motion\
  \ sickness. You don't get sea sick, do you?"
