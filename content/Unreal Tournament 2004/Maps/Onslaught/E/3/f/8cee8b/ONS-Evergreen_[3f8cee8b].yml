description: "There once lived a man|who had nothing to hide|All he really wanted|was\
  \ land far and wide||Then the man went to sleep|and had ajungle-ish dream|but when\
  \ he woke up, he|found it more real than it had seemed||So when he went to Liandri|and\
  \ asked for a hand, they said|\\\"screw you, bitch, we're|taking your land\\\"||And\
  \ so Onslaught rained death|upon this jungle|as it was put to uses|that were not\
  \ so humble"
