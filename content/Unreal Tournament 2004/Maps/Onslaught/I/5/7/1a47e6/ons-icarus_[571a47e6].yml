description: "Soaring 3 miles above Earth's surface, Icarus Plaza was designed to\
  \ be the ultimate residential precinct.  But like its namesake, ambition for the\
  \ project exceeded caution.  Even before the project was completed, significant\
  \ structural flaws were detected and the buildings were abandoned."
