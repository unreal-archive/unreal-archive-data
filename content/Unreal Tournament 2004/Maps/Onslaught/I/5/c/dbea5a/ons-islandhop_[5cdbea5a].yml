description: "This volcanic archipelago served once as a gateway in the human wars\
  \ of the 21st century. Transformed for tournament use, a series of bridges now connects\
  \ the islands. These bridges, though excellent use for ground based vehicles, do\
  \ not provide a direct path to battle. Manta's will be the primary choice for transportation."
