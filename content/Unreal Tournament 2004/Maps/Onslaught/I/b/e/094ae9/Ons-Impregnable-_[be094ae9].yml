description: "In the year 2397, Earth, a 270 acre glacier melted from the western\
  \ coast of what was once South America, leaving behind a mysterious peninsula in\
  \ its image. On it were soon discovered deposits of a highly valued nanyte compound,\
  \ and so it was sectioned off by the NEG for mining, then handed to the tournaments\
  \ for CTF. Unfortunately, the competitors, forced to traverse such tiring distances\
  \ to the enemy base, didn't make much entertaining gunplay on arrival, and so it\
  \ was scrapped... until recently. With the addition of vehicular warfare, this has\
  \ become one of the more gruelling arenas in recent years... shame there's nobody\
  \ within 70 miles to hear you scream..."
