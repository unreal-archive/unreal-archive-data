description: "Set in a decimated earth civilization, FalloutField, is the result of\
  \ a planet wide nuclear war that caused an extinction level event (E.L.E.) around\
  \ the year 2012. The humanoids that buried themselves far underground survived the\
  \ initial devistation.  Once the humanoid's supplies were exhausted, they were forced\
  \ to surface.  Some died within days, others went completely insane before dying\
  \ of their radiation burns, and there were the ones who lived on. It was a select\
  \ few that saw the power of a nation waiting to be taken like candy from a baby.\
  \  They remembered their past and how the support and loyalty of thousands had been\
  \ the result of live blood sport.  And so it was, FalloutField was constructed from\
  \ the remains of a past long forgotten.  The tribes of earth rejoiced in the games\
  \ and for the contestants, it was an honor to die in any combat for their leader.\
  \ The Tournament decided earth would be a nicer place without the inhabitants and\
  \ so they crushed the humanoids of earth. FalloutField is now maintained by the\
  \ Tournament."
