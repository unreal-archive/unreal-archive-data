description: "At the dawn of space colonization, every major coporation went racing\
  \ to establish outposts on Mars and the Moon.  As predicted, many of these bases\
  \ were too costly and failed before entering into operation.  Some companies had\
  \ to sell off their land to the highest bidder just to avoid bankruptcy.  Luckily\
  \ for us, the monnolithic Liandri corporation was able to secure many of these sites\
  \ for use in the tournament."
