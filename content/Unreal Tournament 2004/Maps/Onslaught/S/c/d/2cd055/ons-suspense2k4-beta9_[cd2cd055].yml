description: "Suspense is the only bridge across the Alluvion strong enough to support\
  \ the weight of heavy combat vehicles. Without the bridge, it would take Axon forces\
  \ several days to respond to any battles across of the river. As such, it is always\
  \ under guard by an Axon mechanized division, with military checkpoints at each\
  \ end.  (GreatEmerald)"
