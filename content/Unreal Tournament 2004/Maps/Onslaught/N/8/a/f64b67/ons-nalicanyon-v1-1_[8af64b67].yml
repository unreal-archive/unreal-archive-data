description: "Most people know about the final battle between the Skaarjs and the\
  \ Humans when they successfully destroyed skaarj's mothership in a final desperate\
  \ attack. But few people know how the Nali people fell to the Skaarj ground shaking\
  \ troops 20 years before the Great Skaarj / Human War. Although a pacific race,\
  \ Nali had built mighty fortresses in the Great Nali Canyon to protect themselves\
  \ for agressors. But when all skaarj legions attacked the Great Nali Canyon, the\
  \ Nali just couldn't match with the Skaarj cutting edge technology. Outnumbered,\
  \ they resisted for 3 months before finally falling. Most Nalis were either brutally\
  \ slaughtered or enslaved and sold throughout the skaarj empire. This is how the\
  \ epic story of their fall ever made it to our knowledge, thousands of years later.\
  \ You will have the great opportunity to participate in the re-creation of the epic\
  \ battle."
