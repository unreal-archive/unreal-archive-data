description: "Cain's Lair Regulars Edition - A sandstorm has swept across the desert...\
  \ obscuring it's many secrets... The bases of two warring factions reside in the\
  \ South-Eastern and South-Western regions of the vast desert. The Oasis in the center\
  \ of the Wastes has miraculous healing properties. Special runes on the Western\
  \ and Eastern regions call on the power of the Gods themselves to provide protection\
  \ against foes. The far Northern temple holds great rewards for those who are worthy.\
