description: "A sandstorm has swept across the desert, obsuring its many secrets...\
  \ The bases of two warring factions reside in the South-Easters and South-Western\
  \ regions of the vast desert. The Oasis in the center of the Wastes has miraculous\
  \ healing properties. Special runes on the Western and Eastern regions call on the\
  \ power of the Gods themselves to provide protection against foes. The far Northern\
  \ temple holds great rewards for those who are worthy. ONS-Grit by Vance 'Cavern\
  \ Tan' Tran - vance@vancetran.com - www.vancetran.com"
