  \ AC-X5 in the Arcturus system. A large gravity generator inside the asteroid provides\
  \ Earth-normal gravity to the workers in the mining facility. Izanagi corporation\
  \ has moved mercenaries into this central grav core to establish control over AC-X5\
  \ and take it by force from Axon corp. so they can profit from this resource-laden\
  \ planetoid."
