description: "Years after the collapse of the Liandri Corporation and the takeover\
  \ of the evil Fortnite Empire, an unimagined stone and tech stronghold appeared\
  \ and was handed over to the remaining stewarts of the long forgotten tournament.\
  \ Only the remaining warriors found on UFC, TUS, HOC, SOL, AIM, and HTM will know\
  \ of Invictus, the unconquered arena."
