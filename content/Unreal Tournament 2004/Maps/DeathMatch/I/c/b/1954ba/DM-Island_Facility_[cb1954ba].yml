description: "When the Tarydium became more hard to find, Liandri's industries expanded\
  \ their facilities to high-risk hostile planets. The standard facility complex consisted\
  \ of small extracting units located in abandoned regions. When all the Tarydium\
  \ was extracted, the facility was abandoned quickly in order to avoid hostile attacks.\
  \ The action now takes place in one of this complex, located in a small island.\
  \ The facility is abandoned with no mechanical equipment, but you can still take\
  \ the lifts in order to explore the underground. As you will notice, the industrial\
  \ activity has deteriored the atmosphere and the climatic conditions."
