description: "Team Inevitable presents - The Ultimate UT Deathmatch: Originally the\
  \ fortress of the fabled Agents of Inevitable, the iFullTower is one of the few\
  \ remaining monuments to a civilisation long since submerged beneath a world of\
  \ endless oceans.  Having earnt its reputation as Indestructable since the catastrophic\
  \ tectonic shifts of 2363, the iFullTower is now the destination of choice for the\
  \ finest of Tournament Combatants, where domination of the 150 foot tower itself\
  \ is seen as the greatest Tournament Trophy of all."
