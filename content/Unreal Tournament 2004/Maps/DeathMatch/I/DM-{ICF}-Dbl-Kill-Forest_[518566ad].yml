description: "This is a rather large DM sniper arena which I rebuilt from an ONS by\
  \ Alan Willard.  I tore this one down to the trees and the rocks and then imported\
  \ some buildings and put together new blocking to allow for full use of trans, matrix,\
  \ quad jump mods.  I also did alot of actor work on the edges of the map in order\
  \ to better disguise the rough edges.  The buildings came from maps ranging all\
  \ across the board.  There is a high benefit to players who are willing to camp\
  \ and snipe.  Should make for interesting Freze Tag play as well."
