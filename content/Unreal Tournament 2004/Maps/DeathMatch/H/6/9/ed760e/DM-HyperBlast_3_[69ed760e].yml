description: "The voids of space are vast, and travel through the sea of stars is\
  \ not always safe. Such is the story of the Hyper Blast, once the proud ship of\
  \ a proud warrior, she was thought to the be lost forever. A frigate on deep space\
  \ patrole came across the hulk floating though deep space. The bodies of her last\
  \ \"crew\" were found on board, still clutching theire weapons, and cold hands.\
  \ Hyper Blast was returned to the earth, to once again take her role as a proud\
  \ battle ground in the ranks of the tournament."
