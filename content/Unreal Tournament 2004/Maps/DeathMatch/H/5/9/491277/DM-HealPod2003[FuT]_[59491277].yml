description: "The Tournament Biohealography Center -- nicknamed by Tournament competitors\
  \ as \"The HealPod\" due to the large healing receptacle that can be found at the\
  \ epicenter of its architecture. Construction of this facility started in 2285 and\
  \ was completed in the year 2291. Its purpose has remained the same to this day\
  \ -- to provide the competitors with the ability to self-administer aid as quickly\
  \ as possible to their injuries during the short time allotted between matches.\
  \ There have been many regulations instated by the Tournament Commission to prohibit\
  \ the discharging of weapons within the facility but Tournament competitors rarely\
  \ follow this rule.||Visit www.funrealtournament2003.com to download more free maps!||Map\
