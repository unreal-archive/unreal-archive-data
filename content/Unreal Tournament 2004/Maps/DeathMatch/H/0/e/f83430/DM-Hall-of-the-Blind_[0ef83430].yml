description: "I Can see what you see not.Vision milky then eyes Rot.When you turn\
  \ they will be gone,Wispring there hiden song.Then you see what can not be,Shadows\
  \ move were light should be.Out of darkness out of mind,Cast down into the Halls\
  \ of the blind.                                                           This text\
  \ is from the Game Diablo and i ripped it :-)"
