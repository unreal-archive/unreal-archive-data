description: "When the Lexen Effect started getting out of hand in the late 2050's,\
  \ Mungbeans Inc, a subsidary of the Liandri Corporation, in an attempt to minimise\
  \ the impact to thier precious champions, built a monitoring station in an air pocket\
  \ created by the Effect. Unfortunatly, it was a well published venue, and due to\
  \ popular demand, combatants get to feel the Lexen Effect up close and personal."
