description: "X\nAlgol 1, the only planet in the Algol binary star system, follows\
  \ a figure-of-eight orbit lasting around 204 days.  Both stars are relatively cool,\
  \ therefore the planet's close orbit and atmospheric conditions are able to support\
  \ life.  Night only falls for a few short months twice a year, where the orbit reaches\
  \ its furthest point from both stars. ||It never rains here as such; water seeps\
  \ out of the ground when heated, and forms a thick layer of surface fog and groundwater,\
  \ which is then re-absorbed once it cools.  The native plant life uses frond-like\
  \ leaves or hollow structures to capture moisture from the air. ||Enough science\
  \ lessons, time to fight!"
