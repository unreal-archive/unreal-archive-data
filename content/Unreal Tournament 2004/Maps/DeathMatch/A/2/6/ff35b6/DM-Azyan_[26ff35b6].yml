description: "From the deepest realms of Azyan, the lost temple of the Water God Chalchiuhtlicue\
  \ was thought to be lost forever, its citizens scattered to the winds. Years of\
  \ untamed growth had caused to hide the temple from sight. But one woman, Ariana,\
  \ believed that the temple still existed within Azyan, even while the rest of her\
  \ people had given up the search for their past and a lost way of life. Ariana's\
  \ quest took 12 hard years from her life - years that made her stronger, smarter,\
  \ faster and able to tackle anything she encountered. And when she and her small\
  \ group of believers laid sight of the deserted temple brought tears to her eyes.\
  \ But even though she was the first in 679 years to view the temple once again,\
  \ her happiness was short-lived. Her people's enemies - those that had first committed\
  \ the genocidal attrocities that had killed everyone at the temple - had learned\
  \ of her quest, and were coming to remove her people forever from the world."
