description: "An ancient fortified coastal town overseen by the empirial pacification.\
  \ Some years later, rich aristocrats invested in these small towns scattered along\
  \ the Mid-Sea coast, bringing thus wealth and power. It is here in this citadel\
  \ that the great house-war started, wich in occurence brought down the Empire and\
  \ divised it in petty realms. Now in present days, the ancient citadel part is well\
  \ preserved and the actual village has been built upon the ancient foundations of\
  \ the old town. This place is appreciated by tourists because of its rich history\
  \ and excellent food. Have a nice journey."
