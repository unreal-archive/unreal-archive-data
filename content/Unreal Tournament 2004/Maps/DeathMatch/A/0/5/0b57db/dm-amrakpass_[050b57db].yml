description: "This is a Vehicle DM map based off of UT2k3's hidden map, Vehicle Demo,\
  \ the bulldog testing map. This map uses the embedded VSOverride package to make\
  \ the vehicles work in DM, and Super Ape's TeamVehicleFactory to spawn the vehicles.\
  \ This map also includes an embedded Ripper2k4, made by the Fraghouse Mod Team,\
  \ and advanced spider mines made by \t]<ì]]4, you can stick them to vehicles, they\
  \ are faster, they don't blow up when moving on terrain or if they run into each\
  \ other, and they do less damage. Have fun!"
