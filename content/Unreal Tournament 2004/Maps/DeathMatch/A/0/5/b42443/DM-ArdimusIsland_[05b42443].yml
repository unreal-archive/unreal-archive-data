description: "Ardimus Corp installs discrete tracking systems in every warhead they\
  \ manufacture, generally to prevent them from being used against them if they are\
  \ sold to the wrong party. In retriving a batch of stolen warheads, Ardimus Island\
  \ became the stage for a bloody confronation with the Security Council.  The weapons\
  \ have since been detonated and the island, once used for weapons research, sold\
  \ for the tournaments."
