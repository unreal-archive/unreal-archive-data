description: "Already fallen in ruin and forgotten by the Time the fortresses on the\
  \ Italian Alps were bought, readapted and reinforced by the Liandri corp. to be\
  \ used like combat arenas at low cost. Only an electricity-generating group supplies\
  \ the sufficient energy in order to fight also by night. It' s the dawn and the\
  \ light begins to increase... Turn off the generator, but the combats must continue.\
  \ It' s time for the arena to receive the Alps' Dawn Duel!  ~ Items placement in\
  \ collaboration with JollyRulez ~"
