description: "This map is designed to be an automatic tournament. In the main lobby,\
  \ there is a huge TV for watching matches, a selection wall for choosing the number\
  \ of players for a match and for choosing your number for each round, and two portals\
  \ leading to the arena. To play, shoot the number of players for this match with\
  \ the shock rifle. (ALWAYS use the shock rifle for making selections! Other weapons\
  \ can screw up the selection system!!) Next, each player should select their player\
  \ number by shooting it. Try to do this in a somewhat organized fashion. Once everyone\
  \ is done, the round will start. Watch the numbers behind the arena portals; you\
  \ should get ready to go when your number comes up. There will also be an announcement\
  \ to alert the next two players shortly before the teleporters activate. When it\
  \ is your turn, stand on the indicated pad. 4 energy rings will drop down, and you\
  \ will be teleported to an armory room next to the arena. When the door opens, run\
  \ in and defeat your enemy! After one minute(hopefully one of you will be dead by\
  \ then), the teleporter in the center of the arena will activate, so if you win,\
  \ be sure to go stand on it. While you are waiting for your next turn (or if you\
  \ died), you can watch the matches on the giant TV in the lobby. Once half the players\
  \ have been eliminated, the next round starts. This continues until there are only\
  \ 2 survivors; they fight in the final round, after which you can start a new match\
  \ if you want to. Note--In case it's not obvious, this map is only intended for\
  \ online or LAN play; that is, no bots. Bots are simply nowhere near intelligent\
  \ enough for a map like this."
