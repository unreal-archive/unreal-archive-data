description: "The Atrophos Aquaductus, or Ill-Nourished Aqueducts, once supplied many\
  \ underground defectors of the Corporate Machine a healthy supply of untainted water.\
  \ Selfish altercations between subterranean tribes have turned this once-nurtured\
  \ territory into little more than a degenerated combat arena."
