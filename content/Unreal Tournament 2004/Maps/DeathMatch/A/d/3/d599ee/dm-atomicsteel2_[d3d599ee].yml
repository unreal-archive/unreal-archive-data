description: "All that stuff that we all drew on our elementary school note books:\
  \ nasty robots, dinosaurs eating arm soldiers, hidden indestructible fortresses.\
  \ Its all here. All 3d like. In this hidden fortress, lives Mr. Fun and his motley\
  \ crew of assembly-line clones to join the tournament.True story: a friend in grade\
  \ 4 drew a jet bomber over the underground fortress to destroy it. I said that wouldn't\
  \ work because it was covered in Atomic Steal. I was teased about that for 20 years\
  \ after every time I ran into  that friend. (Thanks Paul!) Here's all my grade school\
  \ notebook drawings come to life. Enjoy!"
