description: "Many centuries have gone,but nobody didn't found this place ever,but\
  \ in a year of War and Destruction,the place was finally discovered.When the humans\
  \ found this place,they were extremly speechless,because the place is unique.They\
  \ found out that this was a place to become immortal,first people thought that this\
  \ was bullshit,but after some time,they discovered something of a very old civilization,it\
  \ was unknown for them. They wanted to examine it,but they never understood it,the\
  \ people who have made this unknown device are disappeared for a long time,probably\
  \ they are living in another galaxy.Today,many people don't like it to go to this\
  \ place,because it is very scary for them,the reasons are unknown,probably the problem\
  \ is their beliefes,they think it is a place of the evil.Actually this is the place\
  \ of the old gods,who nobody didn't ever met,but many people's belief in them is\
  \ extremly strong.If someone wanna become immortal,then he must fight there for\
  \ his life against someone others of his people and sometimes people just disappeared\
  \ there. After all of these things,the Liandri Corporation got the chance to call\
  \ this place another home of the  Unreal Tournament,the warriors are fighting there,but\
  \ the old power of this place is still there."
