description: "Located on top of a mountain in a lush plateau in the Peruvian mountains lies Ayzika. Said to have been built by the Mountain God Apo after he fell in love with Copacati the Goddess of the lake. This magnificant temple like structure and the beauty of the surrounding scenery will surely take your breath away. This is the night time version of this level. Enjoy!!"
