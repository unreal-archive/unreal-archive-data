  \ in this ancient place, where warriors died in the past,  there is a presence contained\
  \ in the red crystals, ant it's evil. Only one day in a year, in this forgotten\
  \ location, the winner fighter can reach the ascension and this day is today, but\
  \ remember, be careful to not disturb the evil essence..."
