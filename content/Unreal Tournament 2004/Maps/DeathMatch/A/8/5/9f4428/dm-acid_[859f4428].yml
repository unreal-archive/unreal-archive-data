description: "After a long night drinking crack and smoking battery acid, an unnamed\
  \ Liandri overseer bet he could get a major game of the professional league to take\
  \ place absolutely anywhere in the galaxy. His companion, a robot-mutant-alien hybrid\
  \ housed in the body of mechanical dog, challenged him to organise the game in a\
  \ literal cartoon. Three days later, he had spent 160,000,000,000.99 credits on\
  \ a start-up promising to do just that and his sudden death (slaughtered with the\
  \ help of 7 different types of weapons and covered with fingerprints of known Liandri\
  \ security personnel) was ruled a suicide. The executive board of the Liandri corporation\
  \ decided to test the new technology it had unwillingly acquired in the process\
  \ and it turned out to be a major technical success. Viewers were disappointed by\
  \ the visual experience, however. The whole thing was shelved after 5 months of\
  \ broadcast."
