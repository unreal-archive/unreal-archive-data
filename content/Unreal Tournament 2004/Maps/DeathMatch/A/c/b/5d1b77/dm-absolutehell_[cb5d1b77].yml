description: "Through the endless battles, mankind struggled to survive on the day-to-day\
  \ basis.  Peace and tranquility seemed far from reach, but several dedicated scientists\
  \ sacrificed several years researching the source of the attacks.  They've finally\
  \ discovered the coordinates to the exact homeland of the source, and they've set\
  \ their teleporter's coordinates.  Many powerful factions entered through the portal.\
  \  None has returned.  Neither did the invasions weakened.  Only the bold may step\
  \ through that portal, and for the ones that return home victoriously, will find\
  \ their names marked in the texts.  But at the moment, the pages are empty."
