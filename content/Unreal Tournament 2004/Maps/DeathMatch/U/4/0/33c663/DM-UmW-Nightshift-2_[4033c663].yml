description: "Once a research center, this building was owned by Byzantech corp. The\
  \ research was claimed to be unknown for nearly half decade until an investigation\
  \ took this literally undergound blackmarket to a hault. Research has come to find\
  \ more hidden areas over the last 3 years, with the push of hidden buttons one could\
  \ find entire rooms the size of buildings. ~Made by UmW_Aeroh_LdR (Used to be Shift)~"
