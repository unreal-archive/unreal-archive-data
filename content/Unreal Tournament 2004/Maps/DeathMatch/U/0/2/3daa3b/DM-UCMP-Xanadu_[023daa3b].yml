description: "In Xanadu did Kublai Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree, where Alph,\
  \ the sacred river, ran through caverns measureless to man down to a sunless sea,\
  \ so twice five miles of fertile ground with walls and towers were girdled round.\
  \ and there were gardens bright with sinuous rills, where blossom'd many an incense-bearing\
  \ tree. And here were forests as ancient as the hills, enfolding sunny spots of\
  \ greenery.    But O! That deep romantic chasm which slanted, down the green hill\
  \ athwart a cedarn cover. A savage place! As holy and enchanted as a'er beneath\
  \ a rising moon was haunted by woman wailing for her demon lover. In from that chasm,\
  \ with ceaseless turmoil seething, as if this Earth in fast thick pants were breathing,\
  \ a mighty fountain momently was forced, amid whose swift half-intermitted burst,\
  \ huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail, or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's\
  \ flail, and 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever, it flung up momently the\
  \ sacred river. Five miles meandering with a mazy motion, through wood and dale\
  \ the sacred river ran. Then reach'd the caverns measureless to man, and sank in\
  \ tumult to a lifeless ocean. And 'mid this tumult Kublai heard from afar ancestral\
  \ voices prophesying war!   The shadow of the dome of pleasure floated midway on\
  \ the waves Where was heard the mingled measure from the fountain and the caves.\
  \ It was a miracle of rare device a sunny pleasure dome with caves of ice. A damsel\
  \ with a dulcimer in a vision once I saw. It was an Abyssinian maid, and on her\
  \ dulcimer she played, singing of mount Abora. Could I revive within me her symphony\
  \ and song. To such a deep delight 'twould win me, that with music loud and long,\
  \ I would build that dome in air! Thy sunny dome! Those caves of ice! and all who\
  \ heard should see them there! and all should cry, Beware! Beware! his flashing\
  \ eyes! his  floating hair! Weave a circle round him thrice, and close your eyes\
  \ with holy dread! for he on honey-dew hath fed,  and drunk the milk of Paradise."
