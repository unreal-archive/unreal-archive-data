description: "Enjoy this much improved version of Under with many upgrades in style,\
  \ balance, flow, elevation, detail, lighting, AI, and a nicely tinted night sky\
  \ with the moon shining down on you to compliment this wild and unpredictable layout\
  \ as you frag out your heart! ... I do believe that was a run-on sentence. Oh well.\
  \ I'm the author. I'm allowed. :)"
