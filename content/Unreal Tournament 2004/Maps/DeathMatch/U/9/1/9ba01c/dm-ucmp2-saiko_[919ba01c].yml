description: "There used to be a time that the Saiko company was a flourishing enterprise,\
  \ a leader in the gas industry. However, for employees, the days were long and filled\
  \ with many risks. It was only a matter of time before someone snapped. When it\
  \ finally happened, it resulted in 7 casualties, all caused by one case of mental\
  \ insanity. Unbeknownst of what it would do to the company, the newspapers nicknamed\
  \ it the case of ''The Saiko killer''. Saiko's competitors cleverly played onto\
  \ these circumstances and smothered the company's good name. Despite a quick namechange,\
  \ the former Saiko company never recovered from the incident.||It's all gone now.\
  \ The dreary halls no longer echo the loud activity that once took place here. Silence\
  \ ruled the corridors for years, up until very recently. Be on the lookout when\
  \ entering the former workfloor, because depression and fear were common factors\
  \ when the place was active..."
