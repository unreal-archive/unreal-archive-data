description: "When the heretic Pharaoh Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten swept away the many\
  \ gods loved by the Egyptian people and replaced them with the sole god Aten, he\
  \ was labeled the Heretic King. After his death, all of his monotheist reforms were\
  \ reversed in favor of the traditional deities of ancient Egypt. Amun was the Egyptian's\
  \ ultimate god, and he sought to be recognized as such over old deities like Osiris\
  \ and Horus. He spoke to Amenhotep in a vision which lead to the creation of the\
  \ city of Akhetaten, and few knew that Aten was just another name for Amun, a god\
  \ that most Egyptians saw as the ultimate power. After the death of Amenhotep IV,\
  \ Amun vowed to avenge the slander of Amenhotep's name in the physical plane. Two\
  \ millennia later, before the Anubian people came to their new home world far away\
  \ from earth, a temple of respect to Amenhotep and Nefertiti was erected in mere\
  \ moments by Amun's unimaginable power. The Anubian people were mesmerized when\
  \ they arrived on their new planet and regarded the temple with the utmost esteem.\
  \ The temple serves as tribute to the King and Queen who sought to consolidate Egypt\
  \ under one god, and a warning to those who doubt the one true god of Egypt; Amun-Ra."
