description: "You know. I really couldn't come up with a description. And to be honest,\
  \ do we really need one? It's a DM map and it's a cool place to frag in. What more\
  \ do you need to know, right? So instead of reading the description forming right\
  \ under your eyes, you could already have pushed the play button. So go on, do that\
  \ right now and enjoy yourself. :)"
