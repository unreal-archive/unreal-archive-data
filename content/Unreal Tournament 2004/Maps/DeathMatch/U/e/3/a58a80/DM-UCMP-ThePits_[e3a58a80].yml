description: "You know, back in my day we didnt have them new fangled guns that link\
  \ together. We had plain old shotguns that fired good old lead buckshot, and we\
  \ liked it! They dont make maps like they used to, either. In my day, all the maps\
  \ had moving parts, and every room you went into played different then the last.\
  \ You kids need to learn to respect your elders and appreciate the great things\
  \ the past brought you. Whippersnappers!"
