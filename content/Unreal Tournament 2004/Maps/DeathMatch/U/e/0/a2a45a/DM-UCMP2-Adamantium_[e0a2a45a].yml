description: "The adamantium refining market took a huge leap forward in 2781 when\
  \ the government declassified its components, allowing a huge number of private\
  \ sector scientists to work on simplifying the process.  The subsequent shortage\
  \ of vibranium, a key component in adamantium, riddled the galaxy with silent refineries\
  \ awaiting stockpile deliveries from light years away.  This particular venue, manufactured\
  \ by Vertigo Mining Systems, was one of the first shut down and has been a staple\
  \ tourney destination for several years."
