description: "The world was outraged. Some called it a crime against humanity. Sodom\
  \ had been found. One of two cities destroyed by the rage of God. It was supposed\
  \ to be a myth one of those stories contained in the Bible to frighten you, and\
  \ keep you in line. But here it stands. Real....with blackened walls and tormented\
  \ structures. Scientists said the radiation levels are still off the charts. Something\
  \ happened here a long time ago that makes Hiroshima look like a fire cracker. It\
  \ was immediately turned into a DeathMatch arena by the  corporation that discovered\
  \ it. There were riots in the streets from Tel-Aviv to London. How could they do\
  \ this. This was too important! Rumours circulated of relics found too powerful\
  \ to fall into human hands. This was of course denied publicly. But somehow you\
  \ knew they were sitting on something. Maybe it was the truth that we really are\
  \ not alone........"
