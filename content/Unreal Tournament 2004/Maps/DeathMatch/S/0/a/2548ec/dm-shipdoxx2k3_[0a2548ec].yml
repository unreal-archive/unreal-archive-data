description: "Once a ground dock for water based ships in the past before space travel,\
  \ it now has been torn right out of the ground(uprooted) and it is now a Sky Dock\
  \ above the jungles for ships of all kinds. Liandri has decided to use it and the\
  \ things that were left on the dock.                          The three  crew members\
  \ that ran the docks are still there in there everlasting sleep. These docks were\
  \ also picked because they resemble the SPACE NOXX arena that Liandri uses .."
