description: "Once a work penitentiary, this complex was decommissioned after the\
  \ solar system's second star exploded. The resulting super nova caused a massive\
  \ climate change. A complex network of heating pipes were fitted to keep the prison\
  \ viable, however nothing seemed to keep the planets bitter cold at bay. Finally,\
  \ it was sold to the Liandri Corporation. It now stands as a relic of a past age\
  \ and the playground of a new."
