description: "Located beneath the Nali Castle; the Catacombs once a place of cult\
  \ and faith. But during the Skarjj Invasion this very same place was used to torture\
  \ the Poor Nali people, but those infamous events lay in the past. In the present\
  \ day we live in peace and so this place is now used as a Tournament Venue after\
  \ undergoing a complete reconstruction trusted only by Liandri's Technicians."
