description: "Wish you were here? Probably not. Since the loss of the O-Zone Layer,\
  \ this venue of Weather Control Stations has been become home to permanent storms\
  \ and high winds. The endless sulphuric acid rain that lashes down has rotted these\
  \ once proud examples of technological progress into nothing more than rusting hulks\
  \ that dominate the skyline."
