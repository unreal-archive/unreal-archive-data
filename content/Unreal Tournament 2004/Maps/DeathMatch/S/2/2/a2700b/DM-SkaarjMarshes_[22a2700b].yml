description: "After the Human/Skaarj wars in 2216 the humans launched a counter attack\
  \ on the Skaarj homeworld. What they discovered was a small neighboring planet covered\
  \ in festering marshland, but rich in Tarydium. The outcast primitive Skaarj tribe\
  \ that occupied the planet were slaughtered in order to harvest the abundance of\
  \ natural resources. So engaged in excavating the Tarydium, its somewhat organic\
  \ architecture was left unscathed only to be engulfed by the harsh environment."
