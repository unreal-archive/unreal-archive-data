description: "In ancient times this swamp, with its foul fumes and corroding liquids, was used by different cults to sacrifice the gods of the dark underworlds. Then for decades a pack of ghouls lived in the cave and terrorized the area. A group of the best warriors were selected to defeat this plaque. In the end only one of the fighters survived. Remembering this legend, skilled warriors still gathering here to see who is the one and only \"ghoulslayer\"!"
