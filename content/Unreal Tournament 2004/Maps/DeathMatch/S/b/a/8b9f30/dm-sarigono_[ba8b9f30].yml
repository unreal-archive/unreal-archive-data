description: "Sarigono once thrived as a busy supply depot and living quarters used\
  \ by the Terran Forces when they established contact with Linos Sau.  A hundred\
  \ years later, it was then inhabited by the LPCS Force once colonization was finally\
  \ established on the surface of Linos Sau.||One morning in 2312, the base and its\
  \ inhabitants were overrun and mercilessly slaughtered by a Skaarjian Fleet who\
  \ intercepted one of the LPCS's unencrypted satellite broadcasts.||Now in a state\
  \ of ruination, Sarigono lies dormant and solemn.  Though the ground yearns to absorb\
  \ blood and the rain drizzles to erase the scorches of battle, Sarigono remains\
  \ brooding and quiet, a mute witness to eternal strife."
