description: "In 3097 Astronauts found a teleporter on the moon, it was brought back\
  \ for further study. As they figured out how to open the gate some form of Egyptian\
  \ species marched in. For 30 years our worlds clashed untill there was darkness.\
  \ It will take great skill and courage to get around the vast plains on a foreign\
  \ Egypt and under the surface of Earth, it is indeed evry man for himself."
