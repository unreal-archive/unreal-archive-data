description: "Deimos Station 5.  This mostly subterranean facility houses a launch\
  \ silo for defending against orbital attack, with four IPR-3 missile launch pads.\
  \  There is also a mining operation here, a boiler room, and an arboretum for recreation.\
  \  The central cargo storage bay is at the hub of the facility.  Of course, it's\
  \ all just tournament fodder now."
