description: "The sand mixes with your sweat, forming a gritty layer on your skin\
  \ that makes you itch under your armor. The air reeks of electrostatic discharge\
  \ and dried blood. From the darkness of the tombs below an inhuman scream marks\
  \ the death of one of your countless enemies. Your only regret is that you're not\
  \ the one who got the frag. Time to fight."
