description: "After refusing to allow the Liandri corporation to set up their Tournament\
  \ on Russian soil, the former Soviet Union was the surprise victim of a thorough\
  \ bombing, followed by the dropping of 400 tons of Granite in the shape of their\
  \ UT2k4 logo. Russia's military was unable to stop the massive brute force of the\
  \ Liandri corp."
