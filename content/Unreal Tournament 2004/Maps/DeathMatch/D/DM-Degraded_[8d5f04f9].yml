description: "Research Station 60AT 'Schull' was a small station and had reached its\
  \ last operating year when the artificial atmospheric altering elements were leaked\
  \ outside by a saboteur of a rival corporation. After half a year of trying in vain\
  \ to revert the planet's atmosphere to its original form, the research corporation\
  \ abandoned the planet.||Over a hundred years later, despite the planet's atmosphere\
  \ being declared non-viable, only one corporation was crazy enough to make use of\
  \ it. Thanks to Research Station 'Schull', even the toughest tournament combatants\
  \ will crack under the planets extreme conditions."
