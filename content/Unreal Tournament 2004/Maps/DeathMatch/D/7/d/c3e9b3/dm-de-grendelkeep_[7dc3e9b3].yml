description: "Prieth Callas was a hard, cruel man, fond of torturing his enemies before\
  \ sending them to their deaths. He raised creatures of great size and ferocity,\
  \ setting them against his prisoners in arenas of his own creation. Grendelkeep\
  \ is the last of his diabolical constructions, left to fall into ruin after Callas\
  \ was dragged from the battlements by his own men and fed to the creatures he bred\
  \ in the dark kennels below. The rain has washed away the blood, but the evil that\
  \ bred here has left a much deeper stain."
