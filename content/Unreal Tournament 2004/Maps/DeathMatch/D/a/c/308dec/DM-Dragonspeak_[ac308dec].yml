description: "Legends say this isolated mountain peak was once the gathering place\
  \ for the wisest and greatest dragons. Distracted by the screams of the dragons\
  \ flying above you and watched by the ever vigilant petrified dragons you try and\
  \ focus on what lies ahead of you. Victory or death, on Dragon's Peak."
