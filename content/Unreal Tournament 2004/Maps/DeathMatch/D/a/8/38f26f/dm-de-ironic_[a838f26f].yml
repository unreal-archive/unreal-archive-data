description: "In the solitude of the abandoned coastal platforms of New Argentina,\
  \ the quiet hum of bird and animal life yields to the roar of rocket fire, and the\
  \ blast of shock rifles. Looks like R&R has been put on hold for today, so grab\
  \ some ammo and get out there. It's time for a little old fashioned deathmatch."
