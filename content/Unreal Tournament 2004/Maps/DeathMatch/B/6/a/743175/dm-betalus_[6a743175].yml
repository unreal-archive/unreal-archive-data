description: "Betalus was a secret training place of the Gen Mo'Kai, to improve their\
  \ fighting abilities during the Tournament seasons. But due to a misspell of one\
  \ of the warriors, the place got discovered by the other clans and was forgotten\
  \ over the years. Recovered by one of the most famous warrior, Betalus became a\
  \ very popular fighting place for the Tournaments."
