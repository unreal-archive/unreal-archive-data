description: "This abandoned Biological labratory once shined so proudly with all\
  \ it's achievement's | |The greatest being a multi celled organism with a fully\
  \ functional heart| |All of the researcher's marvelled at it's glory| |At first\
  \ it took up the space in its container then grew out onto the table after about\
  \ a week, Then half the room, Suddenly the researcher's realised it's threat so\
  \ they moved it to the facilitie's ventilation floor and left it to grow there|\
  \ |After a year of studying it the organism decided to attack and started to chew\
  \ away at the structures around it aswell as the researcher's themselve's, so they\
  \ selled the facility | |Now it grows ever larger feeding off whatever blood it\
  \ can find | |And with Liandri in charge they insure it never goes hungry....."
