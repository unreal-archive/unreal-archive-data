description: "Constructed by an ancient civilization now long gone, these ruins were\
  \ once an arena for the civilization's greatest warriors. They would be sent in\
  \ to compete against each other to honor their gods. In time, nature reclaimed it.\
  \ In time, Liandri found it. In time, its original purpose is once again forfilled."
