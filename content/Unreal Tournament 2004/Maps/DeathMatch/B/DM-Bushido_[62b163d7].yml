description: "Q\x06The foremost concern of a warrior, no matter what his rank, is\
  \ how he will behave at the moment of his death. No matter how eloquent or intelligent\
  \ you may normally seen to be, if you lose your composure on the brink of death\
  \ and die in an unseemly manner, your previous good conduct will all be in vain,\
  \ and you will be looked down upon by serious people. This is a very disgraceful\
  \ thing. - Bushido"
