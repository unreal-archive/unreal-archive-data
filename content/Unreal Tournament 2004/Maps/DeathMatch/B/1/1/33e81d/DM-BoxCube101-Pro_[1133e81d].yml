description: "k\x05Being so very bad at visual fluff I decided to try making a map\
  \ that had none... a map where I could concentrate on making a somewhat decent layout\
  \ and not-stupid item placement decisions, as such things are almost always the\
  \ cause of a map's failure.  Will this one fail?  Probably.  But who knows, it might\
  \ just get it right and be marginally fun to play.  :-)"
