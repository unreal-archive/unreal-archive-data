description: "One of the tournaments set designers had a nightmare once. He dreamed\
  \ about a boiler-room. He met an ugly looking man with a brown hat, red and green\
  \ colored sweater. His face was terrible burned and he had a glove with knives on\
  \ its fingers. The man said he used to work in this boilerroom and bring terror\
  \ up on little girls. The man laughed with un evil sound, holding up a head from\
  \ a little girl covered with blood. Suddenly the set designer woke up, almost scared\
  \ to death. The dream felt so real. He remembered the boiler-room so well, that\
  \ he wanned to have it on the tournaments. He made a full size replica of the room.\
  \ Real fast it became one of the most populars 1on1 arenas for the tournaments.\
  \ But the scary thing is that the set designer died three weeks after the first\
  \ opening night of the BoilerRoom arena, in his sleep with razor cuts all over his\
  \ body. And after that day tournament players claims they have had nightmares about\
  \ the very same boiler-room in their sleep. They say the dreams have been so real\
  \ so they don't know if they really have been on the real arena or in the boiler-room\
  \ in their dreams when they wake up. So be careful before you enter the BoilerRoom,\
  \ you might be in a nightmare without knowing it, and you migh never even wake up!\
  \ Welcome to Prime Time, bitch..."
