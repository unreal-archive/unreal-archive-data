description: "For years the Nali monks managed to keep this sacred burial ground hidden\
  \ from the scavenging Skaarj hoards.  They weren't so lucky with the Liandri, however,\
  \ and the temple was discovered by a routine satellite sweep in search of useable\
  \ Tarydium deposits.  The area was mined, and what remained was converted into a\
  \ tournament arena, corpses and all."
