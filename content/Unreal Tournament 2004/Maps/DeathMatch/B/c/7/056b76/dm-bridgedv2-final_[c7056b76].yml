description: "When a small blip showed up on the scanners of a space probe designated\
  \ LSP-192004, While on routine exploreatory mission to an unknown star system only\
  \ recently detected by long range scans, They were very suprised to find a small\
  \ allmost park looking enviroment with its own atmosphere in orbit of the star they\
  \ were investigating, Radiometric decay ratio indicates that this structure is over\
  \ 2000 years old, Yet plant life and atmosphere on this thing is still as if it\
  \ were built yesterday, It appears to be powered and maintained by a form of technology\
  \ hundreds of years ahead of ours, Our scientists have still not been able to decifier\
  \ most of the systems on this thing, Due to its simple style of overall design,\
  \ Liandri corporation took it up as a platform for its own offairs, Including the\
  \ hosting of Unreal Torunament matches."
