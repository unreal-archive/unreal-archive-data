description: "This archaic temple, carved out of hard rock long ago by the Monks of\
  \ Doublejump and Walldodge, has been unoccupied for centuries. No one is exactly\
  \ sure why they built it underground, lighting the cavern by cutting slits out of\
  \ a massive central column connected to the surface above, but it's certain that\
  \ they enjoyed performing special jumps."
