description: "Set in the former drainage system for the Tokara Forest Arena.  Later\
  \ refurbished to provide a practice arena for the Tokara Forest competitors.  After\
  \ the Forest Arena became mostly destroyed from the constant tournaments, the forest\
  \ and practice arenas were left derelict.  Now, disused and slightly run-down, the\
  \ practice arena was recently re-acquired by Liandri and opened as a tournament\
  \ arena."
