description: "\"Facility.| The word brings chills to the souls of humans across the\
  \ galaxy. If you ever walked in, you never walked out. If you came out at all, all\
  \ that you were was a bit of toxic waste in a can.|| But certain laws, especially\
  \ applicable to the Facility, were passed. Certain \"tests\" were not to be done,\
  \ anymore. The Facility was cleaned up and shut down. The \"subjects\" removed.\
  \ Over time it began to fall into disrepair, as no one would go near the place.\
  \ Local superstitions and old wives tales stopped them. It was haunted, it was cursed,\
  \ it was feared!|| However, before the Facility had completely fallen to rubble,\
  \ an independent sponsor of the tournaments got a cheap lease on the place. The\
  \ Facility was fixed up and it's insides reborn, this time, with a sadistic twist\
  \ ever more frightening than the remains of the former-humans who haunt the place...|\
  \ It was cell-shaded.\" ||-Tournament Sponsor Accurain"
