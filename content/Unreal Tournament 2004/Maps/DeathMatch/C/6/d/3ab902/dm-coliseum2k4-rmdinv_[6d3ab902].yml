description: "The Coliseum brings tournament competitors back to their gladiatorial\
  \ roots. This arena gives players a new environment, new weapons, and...something\
  \ more. Once you play this map for five minutes, you will realize that your competitors\
  \ may not be the only thing that is against you. Remember that nothing ever stays\
  \ the same.  Brought to you by the DMC Lab."
