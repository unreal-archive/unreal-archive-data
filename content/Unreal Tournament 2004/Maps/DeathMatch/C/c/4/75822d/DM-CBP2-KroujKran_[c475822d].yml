  \ never destroyed.  A GEO representative group took it over to research the Skaarj\
  \ technology and to investigate any information left regarding were the Skaarj home\
  \ world be located.  Alas the Information was not found, but many other secrets\
  \ came while uncovering the technology used by the Skaarj.  Now a useless relic\
  \ of the past the Liandri has taken this outpost and polished it up for the use\
  \ of the grand death match tournaments."
