description: "\"Bradford's stunning art gallery was opened in 1904 with an important\
  \ collection of Victorian and Edwardian works following its donation to the city\
  \ by Samuel Cunliffe Lister.||The hall, surrounded by a first rate park offers something\
  \ for everyone.||Exciting temporary exhibitions plus permanent art collections,\
  \ including 20th Century British Artists are on display.\"||This map is my submission\
  \ to PC Format Magazine's \"Design a UT2003 level and win a PC\" contest. (PC Format\
  \ Issue 154 - November 2003)||NOTE: Authors may NOT use this level as a base to\
  \ build additional levels."
