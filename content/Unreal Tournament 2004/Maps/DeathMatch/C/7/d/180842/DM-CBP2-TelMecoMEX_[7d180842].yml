description: "In the outskirts of Mexico City that is now know as the City of the\
  \ worlds has made a little room for the most famous of all sports in the universe\
  \ known as Liandri Tournaments.  In hopes of the Mexican government to keep people\
  \ from dying from starvation and the quick depletion of water resources globally\
  \ they decided to make the Tel Meco Mex water treatment and conservation plant.\
  \  This Plant has given the last hope to the people of Earth after the famous Skaarj\
  \ wars left the Earth in famine and completely an utter disorder.  Other countries\
  \ lined up behind Mexico to combat the aftermath when the idea of the Tel Meco Mex\
  \ water treatment and conservation plant was constructed.  Mexico is not the wealthiest\
  \ of nations anymore, but every nation on Earth is thankful for the helping hand\
  \ Mexico has given them and its people.  These Tel Meco Mex plants only work at\
  \ half capacity currently.  As a part of history in the rejuvenation of the world\
  \ Mexico's government has become affiliated with the Liandri to open up a small\
  \ section for battles to the Death,  to entertain the people of the City of the\
  \ Worlds"
