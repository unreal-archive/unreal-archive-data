description: "Conquerors, emperors and dictators spare no extremity in building a\
  \ new world modeled after their grand designs. Soldiers, warriors and militants\
  \ renounce their lives so the great destiny of nations becomes manifest. And so\
  \ the bones of men serve as foundation for the marble-clad monuments which tower\
  \ over the graves of all."
