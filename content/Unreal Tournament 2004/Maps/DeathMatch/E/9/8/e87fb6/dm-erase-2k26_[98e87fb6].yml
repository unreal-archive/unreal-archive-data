description: "Once, Erase Technologies tried to look ahead and build the future. The\
  \ future didn't work out. ||The project was shut down, the documentation erased,\
  \ and all records were quietly removed from the corporation's official catalogs.\
  \ Yet deep within the complex, an experimental energy core is still running - a\
  \ technology so advanced that, according to rumors, it once existed in another time...\
  \ in another project... and never made it out of pre-alpha. ||The personnel were\
  \ evacuated, the systems continue to operate under outdated and conflicting protocols,\
  \ and the security measures have long since been rewritten to suit the Tournament.\
  \ ||Some projects die without ever being completed. However, for the arena, that\
  \ no longer matters."
