description: "This map was inspired by the Cypress Hill song of the same name.  It\
  \ was designed with Extreme Vicious Onslaught in mind, as well as matrix moves,\
  \ and the ZARK assault rifle.  Other ideas came from DM-Morpheus, DM-420-smoke-up,\
  \ various |EVO| maps, and Marijuana.  Hope you nutters enjoy!  I had a blast building\
  \ it."
