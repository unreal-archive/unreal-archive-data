description: "Once there was a crazy priest who thought that he could find and hunt\
  \ down the devil him self, deep down inside the planet. The priest and his crew\
  \ died during their search in what the priest called the Evil Hive. He came really\
  \ deep down and found some mysterious huge open areas, not yet identified what it\
  \ was. But since the priest and his crew died, everything were soon forgotten. After\
  \ a hundred years later the tournaments went down where the priest once got to,\
  \ to find one of the most dangerous battlegrounds ever. But the most scary thing\
  \ is that it was never clear if it was the devil's hive or not..."
