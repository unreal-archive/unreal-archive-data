description: "The \"Oxide\" industrial plant started out as one of NEO incorporated's\
  \ Testing facilities. It was used for testing how plain old rust would act on different\
  \ kinds of metals under various sircomstances and in multiple different constructions.\
  \ The obtained data from the tests was used to make constructions in their Tournament\
  \ arenas last longer and making them able of taking large amounts of force (from\
  \ e.g. missile impact etc.).                                                   \
  \                   -                                                          \
  \           After a few years of doing it's job, the plant got forgotten and decayed\
  \ (due to the immence increase in usage of stainless steel it got useless).    \
  \                                                                 -            \
  \                                                         Until the Tournaments\
  \ got so popular and more and more warriors signed in. At that moment there was\
  \ a shortage of arenas for the Tournament wars. So NEO inc. decided to give the\
  \ plant a whole new life and purpose than before: A Tournament Arena!          \
  \                                                           -                  \
  \                                                    At that moment DM-Oxide was\
  \ born!!!"
