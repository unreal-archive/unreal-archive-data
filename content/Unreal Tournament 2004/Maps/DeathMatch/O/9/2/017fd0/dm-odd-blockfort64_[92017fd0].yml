description: "Strait from the Nintendo 64, here comes everyone's favorite MarioKart64\
  \ battle map, remade especially for UT2004, the BlockFort.  BlockFort64 features\
  \ the look and feel of this classic map, as well as MarioKart's signature Question\
  \ Mark Blocks, which give you a random item each time.  We've payed attention to\
  \ detail, and think you'll be pleased with the completeness and retro feel of this\
  \ wonderful map.  And props to Nintendo's EAD Team for it's design and layout in\
  \ the first place."
