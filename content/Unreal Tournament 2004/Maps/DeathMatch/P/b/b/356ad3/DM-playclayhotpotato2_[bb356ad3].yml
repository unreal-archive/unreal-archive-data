description: "Everyone's a hotpotato in this level, lots of jumping and moving. This\
  \ is a little tacky and a bit sticky, no wonder, it's made with Play Clay.  Play\
  \ Clay is wonderful, you can make things with it, shape it, play in it, blow it\
  \ up, shoot with it, be blown up by it...Thrown in for extra hopping fun are some\
  \ playclay people."
