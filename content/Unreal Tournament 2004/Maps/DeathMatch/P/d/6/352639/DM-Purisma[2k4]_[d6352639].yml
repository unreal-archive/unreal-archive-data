description: "Long ago, a glorious castle rose to the sky, ruled by noble King Arakis.When\
  \ he was brutally slaughtered by the hands of his young son, the castle was deserted,forgotten\
  \ as time took its toll and the elements withered it away.After nearly a millenia,\
  \ the abandonned castle of Arakis was restored by the government to be used as a\
  \ sewage and water treatment facility.Rumor has it that you can hear screams at\
  \ night, could it be the tormented soul of the old king still haunting this place?..."
