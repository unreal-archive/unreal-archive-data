description: "l\aLong ago, a glorious castle rose to the sky, ruled by noble King\
  \ Arakis.When he was brutally slaughtered by the hands of his young son, the castle\
  \ was deserted,forgotten as time took its toll and the elements withered it away.After\
  \ nearly a millenia, the abandonned castle of Arakis was restored by the government\
  \ to be used as a sewage and water treatment facility.Rumor has it that you can\
  \ hear screams at night, could it be the tormented soul of the old king still haunting\
  \ this place?..."
