description: "During the beginning of the human/skaarj wars an armada of supreme battlestations\
  \ were aligned in Earths orbit. These battlestations were effectively used when\
  \ the Skaarj Mothership entered the orbit of Earth, one of the battlestations was\
  \ the Phoenix, which was heavley damaged. Howver just as its namesake it was repaired\
  \ and rose from the ashes to defend the Earth again from invaders. Due to huge expense\
  \ and going far over budget, one of the engineering levels was hired out too the\
  \ tournament to reclaim some profit."
