description: "K\bDuring the beginning of the human/skaarj wars an armada of supreme\
  \ battlestations were aligned in Earths orbit. These battlestations were effectively\
  \ used when the Skaarj Mothership entered the orbit of Earth, one of the battlestations\
  \ was the Phoenix, which was heavley damaged. Howver just as its namesake it was\
  \ repaired and rose from the ashes to defend the Earth again from invaders. Due\
  \ to huge expense and going far over budget, one of the engineering levels was hired\
  \ out too the tournament to reclaim some profit."
