description: "Nebulon 6 was a remote research observatory deep within the Oberon Nebula.\
  \ While the sector initially attracted tourists looking to take in the beautiful\
  \ cosmic colors, peculiar gravimetrics and lightwave oscillations earned the entire\
  \ sector a quarantine from the NEG. This particular Nebula was noted for it's peculiar\
  \ light quality, the emissions and vibrations of which were detectable in our own\
  \ dimension, not merely in the fifth. Nebulon Stations 1-5 were decommisioned after\
  \ an inability to control what appeared to be safe technology. Using stritium nitrate\
  \ particles, scientists were briefly capable of suspending the elusive brand of\
  \ grativon which was pervasive in the nebula. However, on station 6, violent electrical\
  \ storms began to build up within the graviton collection deccelerators, making\
  \ for unweildy terawatts of energy. While the team was able to control the frequency\
  \ of the outbursts, the violence of their discharge fried local systems and left\
  \ the station with only marginal reactor power, enough to keep everything running,\
  \ but not at all condusive to precise scientific research. Liandri now ships fighters\
  \ to this extremely remote station for a little sightseeing. Be sure to step on\
  \ the button in the gift shop."
