description: "This place was once a holy area for the Gen Mo'Kai, they worshiped their\
  \ gods here, until more and more lizards died here-it was thruely too dangerous\
  \ there-so they cursed the place and Liandri made a arena for the Tournament from\
  \ it. Careful: Who soils furthermore the walls with rassistic things will pay the\
  \ cleaning-dutys!"
