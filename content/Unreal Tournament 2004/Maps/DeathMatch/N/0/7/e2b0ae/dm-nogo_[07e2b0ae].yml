description: "What was once an impressive military establishment is now a crumbling\
  \ mass of tangled beams and and scrap iron. Years of war has demolished the once\
  \ proud buildings and now they are slowly swallowed by the hungry sand. The barren\
  \ land and overwhelming atmosphere of death makes it an ideal place to blow apart\
  \ your enemies."
