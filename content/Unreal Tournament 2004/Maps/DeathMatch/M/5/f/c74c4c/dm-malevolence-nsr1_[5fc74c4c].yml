description: "Throughout the years, due to excessive use this once proud arena fell\
  \ into ruin and disrepair. Despite protests, Liandri authorized the decision to\
  \ cancel the lease upon the facility, for the maintenence costs began to exceed\
  \ revenue. Malcom soon joined the protests, though it was too late for Liandri to\
  \ subside in the decision. The contract had been signed. Malcom announced retirement.\
  \ This act of impudence against Liandri ensued riots galaxywide against Liandri\
  \ for 15 years, and finally, the corporation fell to consumer demand. Now, Liandri\
  \ has torn down most of the growth that had overtaken the arena during its disuse,\
  \ and has renovated and re-leased the once renowned Malevolence. You will be the\
  \ one to relinquish the virginity of Malevolence Newskool. Original DM-Malevolence\
  \ by Rich \"Akuma\" Eastwood. This remake by Virax."
