  \ when he returned from America.  The story goes that when Columbus and his crew\
  \ entered the temple a lot of them disappeared mysteriously. There is an old Inca\
  \ tale that says that the temple was home of the power of the gods, and that anyone\
  \ who wanted to steal this power, will be sent straight to hell and he will be tortured\
  \ for 1000 years."
