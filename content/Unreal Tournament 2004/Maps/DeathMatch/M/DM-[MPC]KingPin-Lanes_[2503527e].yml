description: "This map is based on a Bowling Ally here in my home town. I made many\
  \ of the items used in this map. Also if you go into the Urinal you will hear [MPC]Pyrojack\
  \ (cough) going (cough). He had the idea for the map, and he helped with ideas through\
  \ all stages of development. Also thanks to <AOD> for letting me use their names\
  \ on the score board. And all that helped Beta Test it [MPC]Pyrojack, {GÖD} Cold>Shot<,\
  \ [MPC]BÖTKILLER etc..."
