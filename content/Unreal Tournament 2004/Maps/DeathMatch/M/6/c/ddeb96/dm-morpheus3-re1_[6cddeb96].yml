description: "LMC knew they had found an excellent arena at the very top of a newly\
  \ constructed Galaxyscraper Superstructure. Thanks to the modern miracle of super\
  \ tensile solids, these three buildings reach a staggering 12 miles high at their\
  \ pinnacle. The thin atmosphere and reduced influence of Earth's gravity provide\
  \ an interesting test of the Tournament athlete's ability to adapt and conquer in\
  \ extreme environments.||Edit by \ep\x01\x01Rembo\eррр||For localized versions,\
  \ that used non-standard UT2003Fonts package like standard Korean and Chinese Simplified\
  \ translations and custom Russian, Bulgarian, Serbian and Icelandic translations.|\e\
