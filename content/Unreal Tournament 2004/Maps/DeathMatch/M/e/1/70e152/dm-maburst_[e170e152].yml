description: "Burst was a supply drop for corporate miners some years ago.  The recent\
  \ volcanic activity in the area over the last few years has run off all but the\
  \ most wealth hungry independant miners in this sector.  This supply drop was aquired\
  \ for the tournament after a dormant volcano began bubbling up with fresh lava.\
  \  The zone became know as BURST because the workers were afraid the it would do\
  \ just that."
