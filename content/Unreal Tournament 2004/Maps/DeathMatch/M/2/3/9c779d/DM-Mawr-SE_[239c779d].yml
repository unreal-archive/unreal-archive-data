description: "**- Second Edition - ** The Mawr Facility was one of the most succesful\
  \ of its kind, with profits reaching into billions of credits. But when an accidental\
  \ release of a experimental chemical took place, the planets atmosphere became a\
  \ constant barrage of acidic rain, which has slowly rendered the facility useless.\
  \ The rain isnt acidic enough to hurt you, but your corpse will quickly decompose\
  \ like the rest of this god-forsaken facility."
