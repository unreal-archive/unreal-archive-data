description: "Several millenia ago, the egyptian people faced a plague upon their\
  \ land the like of which would not be seen for thousands of years. A mysterious\
  \ man with strange speech, strange looks and strange ways arrived out of nowhere,\
  \ causing mischief wherever he went. The egyptians built a tomb for him, where he\
  \ lies to this day, under an ancient egyptian spell of petrification. The location\
  \ of the tomb has been unknown for ages, with the only clue being that the tomb\
  \ is located \"under the watchful eye of Horus\". And not a word more was heard\
  \ of the strange man."
