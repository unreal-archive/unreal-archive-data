description: "\x7f\aIn the midst of the Pacific Ocean, 2000 miles from the nearest\
  \ landmass (Chile to the east and Tahiti to the west) lies the most remote inhabited\
  \ island in the world - Easter Island, or Rapa Nui as the locals call it. Easter\
  \ Island is a stunning landscape of volcanic craters & lava formations, beaches\
  \ and unique archaeological sites. The famous Moai, or stone sculptures, hewn out\
  \ of rock by a now lost civilisation have baffled archaeologists for centuries.\
  \ Welcome in the volcano deadened of Easter Island."
