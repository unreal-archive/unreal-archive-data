description: "G\tThe ancient winds howl and a cool shiver is sent up your spine as\
  \ you ascend, propelled by the esoteric enchantments that still linger here after\
  \ thousands of years of abandonment.  Behind you is The Gryphon, hanging frozen\
  \ midair, suffering from an eternal curse for defacing this sacred palace.  Once\
  \ ruled by the Ancients as a magical stronghold where humans could harness the power\
  \ of flight, it now stands as an arena for only the bravest of beings.  Thus, here\
  \ you are, in the New Age of the Tournament, proving yourself to all.  Spread your\
  \ wings - Get ready to be unleashed."
