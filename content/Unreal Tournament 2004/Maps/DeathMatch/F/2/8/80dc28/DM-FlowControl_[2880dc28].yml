description: "Location scouts working for the Tournament knew they had found a new\
  \ deathmatch arena when they discovered this defunct water treatment facility. With\
  \ its narrow hallways surrounding a central pumping room, the facility provides\
  \ fast-paced carnage for even the most bloodthirsty combatants. The only rule here\
  \ is keep moving; if you don't go with the flow, expect to be crushed."
