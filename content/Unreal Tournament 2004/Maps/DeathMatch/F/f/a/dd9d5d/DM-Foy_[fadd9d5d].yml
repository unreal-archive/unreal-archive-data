description: "Built as a platform to protect the enchanted waters of Mount Candaras,\
  \ Foy had thwarted countless attempts from the warlords of Shi'ar to control this\
  \ valuable commodity. Today, the water no longer holds any of its purported magicks.\
  \ With the stronghold's renowned history of famous bloody battles, it has become\
  \ one of the most prestigious venues for would-be Tournament champions."
