description: "When Liandri spotted another one of the mysterious platforms floating\
  \ in deep space, they quickly decided to carry it into Earth's orbit to make it\
  \ another Tournament arena.| This platform is slightly bigger than the old one used\
  \ in the early days of the Tournament. Although old and tarnished the plasma still\
  \ powers the energy-pool making it a deadly trap for those who didn't fell off the\
  \ platform before."
