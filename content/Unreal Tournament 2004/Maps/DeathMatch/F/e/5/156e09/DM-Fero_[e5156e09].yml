description: "Arguably one of the best tournament players to ever live, Sean Fero's\
  \ untimely death seemed premature indeed. Always having a passion for egyptian culture\
  \ and art, it was no suprise to find that the man had been secretly building a tournament\
  \ arena with an egyptian/ techno theme. In memory to the man who had contributed\
  \ so much to the sport, his closest friends and teammates finished construction\
  \ of the arena, fulfilling his dream. Welcome to... the Tomb of Fero."
