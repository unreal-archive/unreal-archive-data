description: "After the assassination of Prince Genko during his birthday games, disgraced\
  \ bodyguard and former Tournament competitor Takeda Shingen retreated to his Ziggurat\
  \ deep in the jungle of Edoka on Nipponedi Prime. As part of his preparations to\
  \ defend against the ruling family's retribution for failure at his post, Takeda-sama\
  \ held a competition in the killing grounds of his citadel to recruit a private\
  \ army of bodyguards. In each contest held only one can achieve the prize of victory.\
  \ Whoever can make best use of subterfuge and defend the weapons cache will find\
  \ themselves well on the path to emerging victorious."
