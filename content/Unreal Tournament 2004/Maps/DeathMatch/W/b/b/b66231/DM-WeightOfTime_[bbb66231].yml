description: "So I FINALLY decided to try and finish up my first level design course\
  \ over at 3D Buzz - which I took to improve myself as I didn't really need the training.\
  \ The assignment was for an Egyptian style map, a theme which I hate, so I decided\
  \ to make my own version of it! I got pretty discouraged after CTF-KelethinRevisted\
  \ and CTF-SkitzoFrantic. But I went off and did some stuff for Morrowind, and decided\
  \ to give UT 2004 a try. I took the feedback I had recieved for SkitzoFrantic, and\
  \ applied it here. Since I'm now more familiar with 3DS Max my mesh work is getting\
  \ better. This is a simple start - nothing more. This is me stretching my muslces.\
  \ My work will only improve after this point, and I'm sure you'll agree this is\
  \ a VAST improvement from CTF-SkitzoFrantic. Now get in there and start fragging!"
