description: "C\x05Yet another beautiful day in the city of Rotport. You are soaking\
  \ wet because of rain, storm of the century is deafening your ears with it's roar,\
  \ every pile of rubble is about to fall over you and those couple of maniacs are\
  \ about to ventilate your carcass with their miniguns. You feel wretched - what\
  \ more can you want?"
