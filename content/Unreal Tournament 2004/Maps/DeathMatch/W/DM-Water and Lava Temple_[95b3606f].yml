description: "Little is known on how this Water and Lava Temple was built inside of\
  \ a dormant volcano at the bottom of Lake Oakachobee in Florida...The island encompased\
  \ the entire lake and was discovered by Link-117, The Universal Warrior himself\
  \ when he drained the water from the lake and exposed it. He was on a mission to\
  \ stop Dark Link-117's invasion of Deinosuchus and other giant reptiles...He stopped\
  \ the giant reptiles here and moved on to other places where they have been sent\
  \ to terrorize the world. Now the place is open (since Link-117 is allowing the\
  \ tournament to compete here) and is the one of the biggest tournament arenas ever\
  \ discovered. This arena could be the wettest, hottest, baddest, and most dangerous\
  \ one yet...How long will you last in this hazardous temple? Will you emerge victorious?\
  \ Or will you face defeat?"
