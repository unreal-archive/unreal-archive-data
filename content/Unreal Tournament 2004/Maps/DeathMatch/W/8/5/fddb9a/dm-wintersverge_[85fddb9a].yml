description: "\"Life's autumn past, I stand on winter's verge.\" --Wordsworth    \
  \                    Long ago, a selfish Baron wished to exact more taxes from his\
  \ peasants.  To force them into submission, he built a keep high in the mountains\
  \ above the village and had master craftsmen construct a complex sluice that would\
  \ control the flow of water into the valley.  If the villagers refused his taxes,\
  \ he threatened to stop the flow of water, killing the summer crop.  The villagers\
  \ were forced to toil under the cruel Baron, until a boy came forward with an idea.\
  \  \"The sluice gates must be opened for the spring thaw\" he said, \"or the Baron's\
  \ keep would be washed away\".  So, after a harsh winter, the boy climbed to the\
  \ keep and snuck inside.  He broke the chains that would release the sluice and\
  \ fled.  The Baron panicked, and sent for the craftsmen to repair the damage, but\
  \ they were waylaid by the villagers at the base of the mountain.  The Baron refused\
  \ to leave his mountain stronghold, and when spring came, both he and his keep were\
  \ shattered and swept into valley below."
