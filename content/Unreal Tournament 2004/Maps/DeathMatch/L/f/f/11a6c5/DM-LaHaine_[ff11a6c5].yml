description: "Madman's factory of hate,   concrete grey of human sin.      Eerie fluids,\
  \ hot and bright,       shine upon me hellish light          and radiation creeps\
  \ my skin...                      -                                            \
  \                  Angels of the deepest dark,               cast to earth in human\
  \ fear,               merciless they are now coming                 put an end to\
  \ all my running                  here I shed my final tear.                   \
  \    -                                                                Eat my bullets,\
  \ dirty bastard!             Came to feast upon my pain?                   Foes\
  \ uncountable I see,                       all of you I'll take with me.       \
  \            No one leaves alive La Haine..."
