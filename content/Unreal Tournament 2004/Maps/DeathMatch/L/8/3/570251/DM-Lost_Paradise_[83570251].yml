description: "In 2298, the Liandri Mining Corp. received information of a rare crystal\
  \ found on a remote tropical planet.  A mining team was sent to to the surface and\
  \ shortly thereafter an ancient ruin was discovered.  The blue crystal, however,\
  \ had an unexplained effect on the miners,  causing extreme violence and hysteria\
  \ and  the entire team was nearly exterminated by one another.  The excavation site\
  \ was abandoned to the Tournament a year later."
