description: "DM-Lin-Chinatown|Alex Linchieh 2004||How do you describe Chinatown?\
  \ You can't. Many Psychatrists have tried and failed. The main problem is that people\
  \ seem to see it in the wrong way. It is not a map, Chinatown is an essence. The\
  \ Essence of Power, the essence of Victory, the essence of luck, the essence of\
