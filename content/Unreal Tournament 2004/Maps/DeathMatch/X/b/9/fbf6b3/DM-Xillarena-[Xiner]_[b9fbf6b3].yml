description: "Welcome to Xillarena. Many great players have trained here to gain their\
  \ power. Now the chance is yours. Take your weapon, invite bots and friends and\
  \ beat them all. I made this map because I really suck the last time in UT2004.\
  \ So I wanted a simply map to train my skills, but I made alot more in it than just\
  \ a map. Enjoy!"
