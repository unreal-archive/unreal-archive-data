description: "This is the first of the ancient Rusty Arenas that were build long before\
  \ the birth of mankind. Until now nobody discovered who constructed these places\
  \ and for what purposes. But it seems that they belong to a long forgotten empire\
  \ of an alien race which developed a tecnology that was built on electro-magnetic\
  \ resonance deflectors (EMRD). Most parts of those complexes are out of order but\
  \ their superior electro-magnetic tecnology is still working."
