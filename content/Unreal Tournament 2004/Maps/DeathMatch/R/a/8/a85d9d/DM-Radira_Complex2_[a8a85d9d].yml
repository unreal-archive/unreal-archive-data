description: "No one knows what the original intent was for this facility, that knowledge\
  \ was lost long ago. However, it's clear this place has been used over time by many\
  \ different races, for many different reasons...none of which were good. Although\
  \ ravaged by nature and the elements, the structure still stands. The screams of\
  \ evil beasts and the drone of some hidden power source still echoe through these\
  \ great halls...a symphony of death."
