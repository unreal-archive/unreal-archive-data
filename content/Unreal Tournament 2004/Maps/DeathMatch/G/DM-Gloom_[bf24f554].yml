description: "r\x05The ravages of nature and man have taken their toll on this ancient\
  \ castle, yet the desolation of centuries past is little in comparison to the outright\
  \ destruction brought here by the Tournament. Given time, the castle itself will\
  \ fall, taking with it the memories of bloodshed within the crumbling walls. Fight\
  \ well, and add to the history here, lest it be forgotten."
