description: "Jerl Liandri purchased this old mechanics garage as a possible tax dump\
  \ for his fledging company, Liandri Mining. Now, Liandri Corp. has converted it\
  \ into a battle arena. While not very complex, it still manages to claim more lives\
  \ than the slums of the city in which it lies."
