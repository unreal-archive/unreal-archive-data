description: "`\tA moon in the Bluhryeid system, Gomeisa began a revolution in galaxy-wide\
  \ power distrobution in the latter part of 3049.  Capitalizing on the vast stores\
  \ of methane a few kilometers below the surface and Liandri Corp's acquisition of\
  \ a few key monoliths on the grid, this remote fusion reactor can instantaneously\
  \ transport massive amounts of usable energy over interstellar distances.  The stimulating\
  \ atmospheric brew (solar radiation, intense energy fields, and methane mist) is\
  \ lengendary in tournament lore, and warriors in the throes of spawn burnout continue\
  \ to rave about its theraputic qualities."
