description: "This map began as Slainchilds' 1on1 Alzonia and was heavily modified\
  \ into something very different.   ---   An underground fortress exposed to the\
  \ volcanic sky sits desolate in distant drylands in an area forgotten and godforsaken\
  \ through a bloody history of war and apocalypse. It first fell when inhabited by\
  \ a 12th century religious civilization who had defied thier gods in place of faith\
  \ in a force of a darker kind.  It had risen and fallen twice over, inhabited by\
  \ desperate scavengers cast out by a 23rd century apocolypse; A time when the third\
  \ world war had become something as accepted into peoples realities as peanutbutter\
  \ sadwiches. Nations procrastinated for months, the end result. Up until the earth\
  \ caught on fire it was childs play to avoid a cataclysmic detonation. A newly born\
  \ faction reigned through decades. Operation second sun took form. The sun looked\
  \ in a mirror at all out nuclear war. Survivors stumbled across a land barren, charred\
  \ and scarce. It was a trip from one hell to another.   There remains only subtle\
  \ signs of each.   It resides empty with no eyes to see it."
