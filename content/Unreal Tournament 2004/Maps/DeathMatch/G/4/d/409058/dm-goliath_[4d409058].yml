description: "High above Calaban VII, Goliath class orbital power stations provide\
  \ the thriving colonies below with both power and protection.  Virtually immune\
  \ to small arms fire, the platforms have become popular staging arenas for the tournaments.\
  \  Occasional radiation leakage has resulted in arenas that are not only entertaining,\
  \ but self-cleaning too."
