description: "The tournament's arenas span all sorts of dangerous, volatile, and even\
  \ grotesque environments. One single arena, however, is singled out as being the\
  \ most hideously deranged arena of them all. So indescribably horrific, that merely\
  \ participating in a single match has driven countless veterans completely mad.\
  \ || This arena is known as the Glacial Sanctuary, | And it, is cell shaded."
