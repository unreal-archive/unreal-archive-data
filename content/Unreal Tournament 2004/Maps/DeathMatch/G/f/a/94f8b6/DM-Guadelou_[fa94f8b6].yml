description: "A building in a far off mysterious place where the birds are singing\
  \ and the machines are humming.  Everything in this place is so very nice and peaceful,\
  \ that is, until you grab a weapon and blow the face off of your opponent leaving\
  \ a gaping  hole oozing rivers of gore."
