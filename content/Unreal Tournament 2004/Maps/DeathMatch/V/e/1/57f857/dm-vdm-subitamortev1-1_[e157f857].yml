description: "Hidden in the mountains of Arborea lies a long abandoned fortress, the\
  \ population was wiped out by a human plague that killed many Gen Mo'Kai all across\
  \ the planet. Liandri managed to make a deal with the alien species by eradicating\
  \ the virus in the fortress, in exchange the location was salvaged to be used in\
  \ the Grand Tournament. The Gen Mo'Kai agreed as they saw the fortress as a relic\
  \ from an older era and instead of using the place for religious purposes, they\
  \ want to give the fortress a new purpose, it's the equivalent of turning a church\
  \ into an arena...., the Gen Mo'Kai truly have a unique sense of duality."
