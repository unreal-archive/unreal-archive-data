description: "First discovered by the forest people of Tebulan 10000 years ago.

When the evil Draken Trolls of Garbon heard of the Crystal Entity a violent struggle to gain control of the cave raged and the forest people were being slowly wiped out. To end the violence and to stop the Draken Trolls from gaining control of the Entity, Lilliana blocked the only entrance to the valley with impenetrable ice shards and she used the magical Icicles given to her by Icobin the ice sprit, to forever stop any of the crystals being removed...."
