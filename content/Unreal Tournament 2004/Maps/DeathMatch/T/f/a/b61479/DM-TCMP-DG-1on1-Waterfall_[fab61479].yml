description: "High in the mountains of Japan stands an ancient desolate temple.  Surrounded\
  \ by cliffs and waterfalls it is the vision of serenity.  Once the jewel of peace\
  \ and tranquility, its Torii beckoning like a gateway to spiritual enlightenment.\
  \  Now long abandoned it sits in fragmented decay.  Will you choose the path of\
  \ inner peace or the way of bloody battle?"
