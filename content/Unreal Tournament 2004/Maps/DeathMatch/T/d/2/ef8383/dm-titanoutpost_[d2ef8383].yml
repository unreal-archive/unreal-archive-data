description: "Life on other planets in the solar system has become nothing but a myth\
  \ at this point, many of them shows us a glimpse of hope that maybe life can be\
  \ found, one of these glimpses is in the moon Titan. Titan is one of the many moons\
  \ found in Saturn's orbit. It's one of the biggest moons in the solar system, bigger\
  \ than our Moon and even Mercury. Titan has been a subject of big interest since\
  \ the discoveries made by mankind, some people even believe that it might contain\
  \ life because of its characteristics. Now in the future many outpost have been\
  \ made trough the solar system and Titan is no different, however this outpost has\
  \ become obsolete, the technology of today demands a complete reconstruction of\
  \ the outpost. Liandri however had other plans for this place and acquired it in\
  \ strange circumstances. Now the old outpost has become an arena for the Grand Tournament,\
  \ how ironic that once an outpost that was constructed to search for life has become\
  \ a fortification of mayhem and death..."
