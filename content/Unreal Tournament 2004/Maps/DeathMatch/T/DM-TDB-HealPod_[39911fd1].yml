description: "w\x10The Tournament Biohealography Center -- nicknamed by Tournament\
  \ competitors as 'The HealPod' due to the large healing receptacle that can be found\
  \ at the epicenter of its architecture. Construction of this facility started in\
  \ 2285 and was completed in the year 2291. Its purpose has remained the same to\
  \ this day -- to provide the competitors with the ability to self-administer aid\
  \ as quickly as possible to their injuries during the short time allotted between\
  \ matches. There have been many regulations instated by the Tournament Commission\
  \ to prohibit the discharging of weapons within the facility but Tournament competitors\
  \ rarely follow this rule.|||Map Credits|-------------||Remake UT2004 Mapper / DM-TDB-HealPod:|Teddie\
