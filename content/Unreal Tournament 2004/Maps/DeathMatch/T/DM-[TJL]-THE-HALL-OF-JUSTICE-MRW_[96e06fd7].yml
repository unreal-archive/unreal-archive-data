description: "Relive your childhood. Who didn't watch this show every Saturday morning?\
  \ This map was requested by The Justice League Clan. Nobody ever does requests,\
  \ but I liked the  idea. I hope you like it. Thanks to everyone that helped with\
  \ this map. BIG thanks to [MPC]ACRUCESALUS  for all the help with the code stuff\
  \ and Jet. Hopefully UT3 will be out soon."
