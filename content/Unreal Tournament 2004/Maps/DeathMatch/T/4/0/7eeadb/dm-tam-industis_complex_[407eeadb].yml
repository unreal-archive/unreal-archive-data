description: "Once a deep underground bunker. This complex was built to house the\
  \ leaders of a once advanced human empire. However they were wiped out before they\
  \ could ever put this bunker to use. The bunker has since been bought by the tournament\
  \ industry so that the modern gladiators may destroy eachother."
