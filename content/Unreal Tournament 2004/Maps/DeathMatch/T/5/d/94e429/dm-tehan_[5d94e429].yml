description: "T\aThe Tehan Production Facility only operates at night and only under\
  \ full moon; the reasons for this working schedule are unknown, as are the contents\
  \ of the mysterious boxes it produces. Its use as an arena in the tournament is\
  \ costly and limited to only once a month.||Only experienced contestants are allowed\
  \ inside but they must take care not to unravel the secrets of this facility - doing\
  \ so will certainly result in the removal of the arena from the tournament."
