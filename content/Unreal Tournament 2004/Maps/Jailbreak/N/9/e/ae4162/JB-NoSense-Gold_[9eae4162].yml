description: "A Jailbreak facility like no other, this extra-dimensional site was\
  \ a highly classified experiment used to incarcerate only the most dangerous criminals.\
  \ However the experiment failed when the prisoners disappeared along with their\
  \ jailers. Later approved \"clear\" for Tournament combatants, NoSense is among\
  \ the most dangerous and bizarre prisons in the galaxy. Note: Captured teams are\
  \ rumored never to return to the Tournament."
