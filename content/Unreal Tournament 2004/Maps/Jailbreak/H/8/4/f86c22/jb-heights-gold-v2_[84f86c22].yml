description: "High above the darkening urban sprawl, the breeze pushes the remains\
  \ of the sunset onto the still, mirror-like windows of the abandoned heights.  Work\
  \ on this building stopped almost a year ago now.  The construction company, being\
  \ too afraid of tournament sponsors, have left all their equipment scattered over\
  \ the half-built towers.  The only sounds that will be coming from this building\
  \ tonight will be the screams and triumphs of the tournament competitors battling\
  \ on this deadly skyscraper..."
