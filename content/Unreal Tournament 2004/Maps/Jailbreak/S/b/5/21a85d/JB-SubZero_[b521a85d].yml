description: "Another underground ice palace was discovered by Liandri and immediately\
  \ converted for Jailbreak use. Its beauty is deceptive, from the razor-sharp crystals\
  \ that illuminate the palace, to the freezing cold waters that flow beneath the\
  \ ice. With sub-zero temperatures, you'll want to keep moving.||You aren't much\
  \ use as a block of ice."
