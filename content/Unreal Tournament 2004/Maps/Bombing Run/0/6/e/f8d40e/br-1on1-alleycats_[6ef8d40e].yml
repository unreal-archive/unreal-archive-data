description: "Everyone knows all about Morpheus, one of the most popular Deathmatch\
  \ arenas in the Tournament. Many players have slipped and fallen to their deaths\
  \ in the city far below. But other than corpse cleanups, what goes on down there?\
  \ A dark alley beneath the giant towers has been converted into an arena. It is\
  \ used primarily for sudden death after an indecisive fight on top of the towers.\
  \ The towers are even more incredible from below, but don't gaze up at the towers\
  \ for too long, or you will lose quickly. Fight back hard and fast, however, and\
  \ you just might win."
