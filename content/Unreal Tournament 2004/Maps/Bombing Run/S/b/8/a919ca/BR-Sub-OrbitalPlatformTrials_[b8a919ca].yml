description: "This Sub-Orbital Platform was created  as an Advanced Comunications\
  \ Relay in this sector of space and was placed over an active volcano.To prevent\
  \ the loss of the platform Liandri put concrete walls to prevent the last remaining\
  \ crew from disabling the anti-grav generators in the middle section by the solar\
  \ panels before the facilty became automated.Somehow the concrete walls were broken\
  \ but no one could be blamed since all the remaining crew had been evacuated to\
  \ the orbiting recovery ship.As it was automated Liandri decided to use the platform\
  \ as a bombing run trials! Good luck and watch your step or you'll be toast!"
