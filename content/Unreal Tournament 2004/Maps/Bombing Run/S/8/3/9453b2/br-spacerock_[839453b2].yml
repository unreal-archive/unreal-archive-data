description: "t\aAn old and retired bussinessman had a dream. He wanted to build his\
  \ own piece of heaven, but also his own piece of hell, because he knew very well\
  \ that his wealth was not completely honestly acquired. Using his massiv load of\
  \ influence he got a deserted asteroid, already fitted with a gravity generator\
  \ and athmosphere, once placed by a long gone alien civilisation. He decorated it\
  \ the (expensive) way he liked, and after his death, the rock was sold to the Liandri\
  \ Corperation for a cheap price."
