description: "This is just a small arena BR map I made in an hour or so, just as a\
  \ test of a concept. It is made for people who like arena BR, and it is made for\
  \ people who like low-grav instagib. It does have pickups, but I reccommend you\
  \ play it as a low grav instagib map. Hope you enjoy it."
