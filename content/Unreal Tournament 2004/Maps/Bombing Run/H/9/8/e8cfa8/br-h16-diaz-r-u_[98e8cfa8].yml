description: "The Planet Stuttez was found un-inhabited what seemed like 1000's of\
  \ years ago. Diaz the Resident Unrealist found himself exploring only to find some\
  \ great areas to re-open and bringing in the Tournament's Tech work team. To see\
  \ if they could get their technology to get the once used power back on to fully\
  \ working order. The area worked out to be large playing ground where your going\
  \ to have to work out the best path for you and your team."
