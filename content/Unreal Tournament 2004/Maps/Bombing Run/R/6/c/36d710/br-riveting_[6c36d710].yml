description: "Implanted on the surface of an entirely frozen planet, this drilling\
  \ complex never saw use as new environmental regulations prevented the exploitation\
  \ of natural ressources on virgin worlds at the last minute. As the only loophole\
  \ concerns cultural journeys, the Liandri Mining Corporation found a way to cash\
  \ in on its assets by organizing pitched battles in these riveting landscapes. Remember,\
  \ you're all officially registered as tourists."
