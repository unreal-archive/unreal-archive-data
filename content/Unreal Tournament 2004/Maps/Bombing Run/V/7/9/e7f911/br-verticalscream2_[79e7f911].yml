description: "Vertical Scream is Liandri's sneak surprise for the viewing season.\
  \ Held on a far away chilly planet in an alien city (smart people think). The archeological\
  \ area may have held the same type of activity: a  bloody match. The map is fast\
  \ paced and has surprises. Play on any bot level, the higher, the better, the  bots\
  \ will love you."
