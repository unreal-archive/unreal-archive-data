description: "Before the competition has begun, there was silence. More early there\
  \ have been heard the sounds of arriving and departing trains; under the ceiling\
  \ the doves have lived but now just only the sound of burns trembles the walls.\
  \ Decorated with red and blue lamps of the corporation Liandri the old station seems\
  \ new but the squeaking of the metal remember now old this station is. Past never\
  \ returns and there won't arrive any train."
