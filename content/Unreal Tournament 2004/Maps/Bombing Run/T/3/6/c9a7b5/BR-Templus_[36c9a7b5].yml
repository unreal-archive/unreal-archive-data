description: "This sanctuary was first built to serve as a safe haven for the souls\
  \ of the bravest warriors to find their eternal rest in. In contradiction to it's\
  \ purpose, the spirits used the sanctuary as a battlefield to fight a never-ending\
  \ struggle for victory. You're on the brink of entering this defiled temple. Are\
  \ you reay to join the spirits, or will you give the one way ticket to your opponent?"
