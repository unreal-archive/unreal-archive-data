description: "The static towers of the Marakan flow have proven to be one of the most\
  \ popular venues in the Tournaments since their introduction last season. The true\
  \ nature of the modern gladiator is revealed as participants butcher their way to\
  \ victory. Whether competing in CTF or Bombing Run competitions, players must keep\
  \ one thing in mind at all times as they do battle in the poisonous skies of Purgatory\
  \ -- It's a long way down."
