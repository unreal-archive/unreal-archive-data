description: "The Earth is ruined by humans, world taken over by machines... the worst\
  \ future ever could happen. You are a slave of machines. You only exist to give\
  \ life to an AI, long ago created by one of your kind. Welcome to the Machinery\
  \ Hell. |\e√ø\x01\x01Doubled the amount of PlayerStarts, added 2nd goals for both\
  \ bases, recreated ultra saturated and enhanced lighting, replaced Grenade Launcher\
  \ with Redeemer, added JumpPads to bases and bottom, swapped shields with Rocket\
  \ Launcher and Flak Cannon pickups, re-textured some minor things, modified placement\
  \ of some objects, adjusted certain ambient sounds.|... and no folks, I have no\
  \ idea why I keep updating this map each year?"
