description: "Duality through Chess. Duality into Life. Duality beyond Death. Duality beneath my double personnality. The way of Good against the way of Evil. White against Black. Me against  myself. This map is not a simple map, only made to frag some fucky bots ; it is a symbol of my own personnality too. Not only the Chess itself, but also the concept of Duality. Gemini. Duality. Defeat against Victory ; me against myself."
