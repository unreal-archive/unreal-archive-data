description: "A fresh gust of wind blows away the warmth of the afternoon. Your footprints\
  \ on the hard tiles disappear as nature carelessly moves the dust about. How long\
  \ have you been fighting this now aimless battle? Does anyone in this arena still\
  \ desire a fleeting victory or a tenuous speck of glory? But your mind is clear,\
  \ you know the fight needs no reward. Even without spectators; even with no cheering\
  \ crowd.||The gods of war watch over, a champion shall be named."
