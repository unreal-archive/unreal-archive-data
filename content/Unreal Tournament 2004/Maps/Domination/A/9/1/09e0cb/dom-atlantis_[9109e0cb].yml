description: "This great, mythical metropolis may have sunk to the darkest depths\
  \ of the ocean, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's off limits to the Tournament.\
  \ Even though it's located 20,000 leagues under the sea, strange Atantean powers\
  \ ensure that the competitors won't get so much as a toe wet."
