description: "If anyone ever made a holiday resort for tournament competitors then\
  \ this would be it. A few miles out at sea in the tropics, this is an idylic island.\
  \ At it's centre lies both domination points, one above the other. This setup means\
  \ that teams have to hold the base for longer than normal to score. This makes scoring\
  \ increasingly difficult. The enemies are cunning and tricky and the base is about\
  \ ten seconds away from any spawn point so a small error can result in disaster\
  \ for the team. There is no escape from this island as the cliff faces are sheer\
  \ drops."
