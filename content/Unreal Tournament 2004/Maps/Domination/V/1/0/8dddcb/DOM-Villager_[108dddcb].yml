description: "The Tournament has transformed even the most tragic of human endeavors\
  \ into glory and profit.  Once-thriving towns and villages are ravaged by local\
  \ conflict, and the only action taken by the greater civilization is to establish\
  \ tournament competition in the heart of the battles.||It is a cruel state of affairs,\
  \ but the Tournament entertains the galaxy, including the masses of the displaced."
