description: "In the second colony, the Earth had around of thousands of spy satellites,\
  \ but with the new government many of those platforms were disabled or destroyed.\
  \ This is one of the 16 remaining platforms that still moving around Earth. Some\
  \ of the remaining platforms were used as laboratories or as normal satellites.\
  \ But this one had a different fate, because Liandri put their eyes on this place,\
  \ and they decided to turn it into an tournament arena. But this arena have something\
  \ different; the domination points are in the center and not in the sides. So you\
  \ have a match full of action, because in every moment the ten seconds are running\
  \ out.||Do you will try it?||Or is too much adrenaline for you?"
