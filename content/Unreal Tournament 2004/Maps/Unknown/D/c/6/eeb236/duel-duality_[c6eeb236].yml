description: "Duality through Chess. Duality into Life. Duality beyond Death. Duality\
  \ beneath my double personnality. The way of Good against the way of Evil. White\
  \ against Black. Me against  myself. This map is not a simple map, only made to\
  \ frag some fucky bots ; it is a symbol of my own personnality too. Not only the\
  \ Chess itself, but also the concept of Duality. Gemini. Duality. Defeat against\
  \ Victory ; me against myself."
