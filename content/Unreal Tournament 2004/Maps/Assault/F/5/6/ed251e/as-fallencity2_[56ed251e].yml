description: "Following the human/skaarj war, many of Earth's cities lay in ruins.\
  \  When the New Earth Government attempted to assert its authority over these areas,\
  \ they were confronted by many rebel groups, often covertly financed by the great\
  \ corporations, which had established bases in the destroyed cities. This scenario\
  \ recreates the destruction of a rebel command center by NEG forces. In keeping\
  \ with the historical battle, the attacker's insertion point is a distance away\
  \ from the command center, because of the heavy anti-aircraft protection around\
  \ the bunker."
