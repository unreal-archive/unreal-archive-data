description: "This scenario is based on an infamous episode of a popular Holovision\
  \ program. In the original episode, two teams of mechanics were competing to make\
  \ their vehicle operational and escape the junk yard. The unexpected twist occurred\
  \ when the losing team pulled out some makeshift weapons and pounded the other team\
  \ into oblivion before they could make their escape. Since there was no explicit\
  \ rule forbidding violence in the competition, they were declared the winners, and\
  \ a new Tournament classic was born."
