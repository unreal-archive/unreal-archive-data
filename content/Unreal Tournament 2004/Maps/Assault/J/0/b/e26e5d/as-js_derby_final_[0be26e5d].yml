description: "After building a small group of planets into thriving production plants\
  \ and becoming multi-trillionnaires Scrivy and Jamie got bored with their excessive\
  \ wealth. To add some excitement to their lives, they decided to use the unreal\
  \ competitors as pawns in a new game. Returning to their home planet, the pair built\
  \ a challenging racetrack, 2000 feet above the surface of the planet, and challenged\
  \ two teams to take it on, in a new perilous assault arena. Teams take on five floors\
  \ of preilous racing. The jumps floor, the interior floor, the moving floor, the\
  \ puzzle floor, and the final sprint to the end! The prize for the winners, £1,000,000,000.\
  \ The prize for the losers, a long fall down! And so it came to pass that combatants\
  \ queued up, to earn their biggest paycheck ever. So far none of the entrants have\
  \ ever made it to the end, not because of fierce defending, but due to the sheer\
  \ difficulty of the track. Can you conquer the circuit, or will you crash and fall\
  \ to the delight of the onlookers? (Thanks to Jamie for a lot of help and ideas\
  \ in building!)"
