description: "This scenario recreates the Rising Rebellion of 2274, on the planet\
  \ Lunaer IV.||Miners, brutally opressed by their ruling overlords, staged a coup\
  \ d'etat on the city of Cirban under the banner of the Rising Class (RC).||By quickly\
  \ disabling Cirban's power and communications center, city officials were never\
  \ able to send off distress signals.||Without aid from the sister planets, Lunaer\
  \ I-V, Cirban fell swiftly and surely into the hands of the RC forces."
