description: "The children of Huddersfield have saved up their pocket money for 5\
  \ weeks in order to mount an assault on the Great Yorkshire Chocolate Factory. They\
  \ have devised a plan to attack the factory and to pump the chocolate throught the\
  \ sewers so that they can get unlimited access. First we must enter the building\
  \ through the main entrance which will have been exploded by our under cover team,\
  \ then we must gain access to the lower levels. Then the chocolate machines must\
  \ be turned off so that we can handle the pipes later on. The toilets must be then\
  \ blocked so that the sewage pipe can also be handled. To block the toilets we need\
  \ large amounts of toilet paper located in the storage room upstairs. Once the toilets\
  \ are blocked we can swap the sewage and chocolate pipes and reactivate the machines\
  \ pumping the sweet chocolate into the streets via the sewer system. You must then\
  \ escape, a mercenary doesn't get paid if he dies."
