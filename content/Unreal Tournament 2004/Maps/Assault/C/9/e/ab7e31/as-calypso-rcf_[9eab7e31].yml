description: "This scenario is based on 'FlaTClaN: The Movie - Episode 1: A Skaarj\
  \ Manace', where a small group of prisoners managed to escape from a high security\
  \ skaarj prision and helped defending the communication outpost codenamed 'Calypso'.\
  \ This scenario recreates that situation, except the prisoners never escaped, so\
  \ the Outposts Marine Division must hold it alone and fight off any invading skaarj\
  \ forces. The invading Skaarj Forces will be represented by the Attackers, while\
  \ the Defenders represent the Marine Forces trying to Defend the Outpost."
