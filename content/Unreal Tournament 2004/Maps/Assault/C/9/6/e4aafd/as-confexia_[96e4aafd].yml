description: "2049: Once the proud capital city of a powerful militaristic nation,\
  \ Celeste has long fallen to the devastation of the Great Wars. Now being used as\
  \ a military stronghold, the citys remnants serve as a battlefield to fend off an\
  \ invading army. The great fortress Confexia, with its massive steel walls, provides\
  \ outstanding protection against any attack inside the city. The invaders will face\
  \ a humiliating defeat if they fail to convert several outposts outside of Confexia,\
  \ before mounting an attack on the great fortress herself."
