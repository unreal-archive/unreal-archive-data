description: "After the long peace, no-one expected a full scale attack on the Earth!\
  \ There was warning, enough to get four ships into space. On board the Ship carrier\
  \ Lennet, General Isol ordered the four ships to leave their sheild down to conserve\
  \ on power. This was a mistake! Alarms rang throughout the fleet, a slipstream portal\
  \ oppened up above the Earth ships and openned fire. Two of the lead ships were\
  \ instantly transformed into blinging suns, and were gone. Isol ordered the override\
  \ for the sheilds, with the fire homing in on the Lennet, it would not be in time.\
  \ Another blinding sun followed, but it was not the Lennet! Somehow the Coruga had\
  \ managed to place itself as a sheild for the Lennet. All that remained was the\
  \ Lennet and its fighter crew. All hands to their fighters, engage!!!!!"
