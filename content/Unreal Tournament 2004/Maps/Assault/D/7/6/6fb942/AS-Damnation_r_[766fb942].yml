description: "This scenario is a recreation of the attempt by Hellion forces to destroy\
  \ the vital Thermoelectric Dam on Fornacis.  The dam had already been weakend by\
  \ numerous erruptions and was a ripe target for the Hellions.  While the generators\
  \ themselves could be easily sabotaged, their loss would have been easy to replace.\
  \  However, weaknesses in the dam exploited with properly placed explosives could\
  \ permenantly reduce the power source to rubble."
