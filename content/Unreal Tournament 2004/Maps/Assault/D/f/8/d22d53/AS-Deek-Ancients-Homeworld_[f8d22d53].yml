description: "Ancients Planet, the secret of the machines, mostly scrap metal from\
  \ a war so long ago that the radiation levels are 0, life of sorts had returned.\
  \ However, the ancients had built well and some defence grids remain active. Here\
  \ you must find and destroy the machines capability to create the human control\
  \ chip, believed to be the main frame situated on a remote island. Without this\
  \ chip the machines will be powerless. END THIS NOW!"
