description: "In one of the most daring acts of the mostly covert Corporation Wars,\
  \ Izanagi Corporation's research facility on Lamdon 3 was raided and destroyed by\
  \ a strike force from the Axon Research Corporation, despite the protection offered\
  \ by the elite NEG ThunderCrash force.  This scenario recreates that mission.  Axon\
  \ was able to not only destroy the facility, but also retrieve the advanced plasma\
  \ ion tank under development there.  You must infiltrate the facility, steal the\
  \ plasma ion tank, and destroy the entire facility."
