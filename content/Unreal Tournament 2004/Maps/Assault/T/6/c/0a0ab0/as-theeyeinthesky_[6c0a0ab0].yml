description: "Long ago in a far away galaxy a civilization is preparing sacrifices\
  \ to satisfy the hunger of their angry gods, a game is played where the players\
  \ must complete a certain set of objectives before time runs out while also defeating\
  \ all opposition that presents itself.||After countless eons this civilization was\
  \ thought to be nothing but myths until Liandri received a special invitation from\
  \ an unknown source about a challenge in the far distant corner of the galaxy, the\
  \ instructions were simple: send the best gladiators to this desolated planet and\
  \ complete a set of objectives to receive the most prestige reward : immortality\
  \ , the names of the winners will be immortalized and worshiped for endless generations.\
  \ Liandri accepted the invitation and prepared to embark to this unknown sector\
  \ of the galaxy to win the ultimate game.||Only true champions will prevail."
