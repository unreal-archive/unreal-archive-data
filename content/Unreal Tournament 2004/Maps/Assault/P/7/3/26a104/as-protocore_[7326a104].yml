description: "The United Shipping Corporation is a valuable goods transport and transfers\
  \ company that was reputed to have had one hundred percent success rates in all\
  \ of its transport runs. That was until the Hellions decided to attack and hijack\
  \ the U.S.C. Expeditious, which was carrying an experimental energy core which was\
  \ to be tested for use in various new startship engines for the New Earth Government.\
  \ The NEG, hearing of the ship's takeover, dispatched a reclamation force in order\
  \ to reclaim the energy core so it would not fall into the wrong hands via the black\
  \ market."
