description: "This scenario is a recreation of the Liandri robot uprising on the mechanical\
  \ asteroid of LBX-7683 and the subsequent quelling of this rebellion by human forces.\
  \ LBX-7683 was an outpost for research and development of the next generation of\
  \ Liandri robots. Liandri's best scientists were able to introduce increasingly\
  \ sophisticated artificial intelligence into the machines that they designed. Eventually,\
  \ they rebelled against the humans and took the asteroid as their own, brutally\
  \ disposing of their creators and mining the rich materials embedded within the\
  \ rock for their own gain. Liandri's commanders devised a plan to strike directly\
  \ at the production facility manufacturing the robots. During an all-out assault\
  \ on the world, a small team was inserted with the sole goal of destroying the AI\
  \ generators, thereby destroying the ability of the machines to reproduce themselves\
  \ and ending this uprising."
