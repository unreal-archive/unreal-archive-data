description: "Due to the treacherous asteroid field and the advanced defense systems\
  \ surrounding the Acatana research facility, no intruders had been near the planet\
  \ for years.  When the Skaarj Marauders heard rumors of a highly lucrative technology\
  \ hidden there, they decided to make it their own.  This scenario recreates the\
  \ Skaarj attack on the Acatana research facility, and the battle to penetrate the\
  \ planet's asteroid field."
