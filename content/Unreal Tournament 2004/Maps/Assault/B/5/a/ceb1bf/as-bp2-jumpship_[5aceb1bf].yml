description: "During the height of the Corporation Wars, Liandri scientists created\
  \ a prototype Warship capable of making its own jumps without the need for a jumpgate.\
  \  Shortly before its maiden voyage, Izanagi spies learned of the prototype Jumpship\
  \ and launched an operation to steal it.  This scenario recreates the historic battle\
  \ in which Izanagi forces infiltrated the prototype Liandri Jumpship, activated\
  \ its engines, and made a successful jump to Izanagi space."
