description: "log : 19 April 2512 -- 80% of the buildings is produced out of concrete\
  \ because all other recourses are already gone. After years of research they found\
  \ out that the green stuff of the Biorifle, the mutagenic sludge, was touching Nature\
  \ and created strange mutations that are eating stones and Concrete, We are calling\
  \ them Greenies. All production was stopped. Deep underground there are still activities\
  \ of the green Mutagenic sludge. It can be reproduced by mixing it with special\
  \ designed engines. only pure metal like the walls are the only materials to trap\
  \ them. If you are part of the Green Clan then you need to restart the production\
  \ process of the sludge by restarting the engines. Because you believe that the\
  \ greenies are soul keepers and therefore being killed by a greenie means Living\
  \ forever in a spiritual way. If you are from the research team then you need to\
  \ do everything to stop them from producing new Mutagenic sludge. Because you know\
  \ that You only live ones. And that we need to safe our planet."
