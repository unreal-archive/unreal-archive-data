description: "(Requires the Editor's Choice Edition Bonus Pack)||Listen up jar-heads...\
  \ We've got a little training exercise lined up for today. The Attacking Team must\
  \ unlock 3 sets of security gates to gain access to a Prototype Plasma Scorpion\
  \ and then escape with it. The Blue Team must prevent this at all costs. For all\
  \ other required information, you should have already read your mission guide (refer\
  \ to the enclosed ReadMe files). Good Luck."
