description: "(Requires the E.C.E. Bonus Pack)||Listen up jar-heads... We've got a\
  \ little training exercise lined up for today. The Attacking Team must unlock 3\
  \ sets of security gates to gain access to a Prototype Plasma Scorpion and then\
  \ escape with it. The Blue Team must prevent this at all costs. (For information\
  \ regarding your vehicles, you should have already read your enclosed file). Good\
  \ Luck."
