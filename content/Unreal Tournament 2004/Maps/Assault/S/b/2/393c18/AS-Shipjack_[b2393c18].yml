description: "A re-creation of a recent near catastrophe. A freighter ship containing\
  \ valuable cargo was hijacked in deep-space and its course was adjusted to send\
  \ it careening towards earth, with all of its precious and highly-explosive cargo.\
  \ With only a little more than an hour to react, it was decided that a special ops\
  \ team would fly up along side the freighter and board it via the cargo bay. Then,\
  \ the team would move through the freighter, input new coordinates at the docks,\
  \ and complete the manual override at the bridge. This task was made exceptionally\
  \ hard due to the freighter's emergency onboard defenses now being used against\
  \ the special ops team."
