description: "This is the story about a fallen mapper, who after 25 years of mapping,\
  \ left with no inspiration at all, hit rock bottom and created the smallest, ugliest\
  \ and worst Assault-map in history. Even though he had a number of well received\
  \ maps under his belt, nothing could prepare the community for this abomination:\
  \ AS-Shole !!"
