description: "-Final Version-      A re-creation of a recent near catastrophe when\
  \ a freighter ship containing valuable cargo was hijacked in deep-space and its\
  \ course was adjusted to send it careening towards earth, with all of its precious\
  \ and highly-explosive cargo. With only a little more than an hour to react, it\
  \ was decided that a special ops team would fly up along side the freighter and\
  \ board it via the cargo bay. Then, the team would move through the freighter, input\
  \ new coordinates at the docks, and complete the manual override at the bridge.\
  \ This task was made exceptionally hard due to the freighter's emergency onboard\
  \ defenses now being used against the special ops team."
