description: "This is facility X-202 Abyss, otherwise known as the 1000 league deathtrap.\
  \  Weapon manufacturers for the fourth World War originally used the facility for\
  \ testing of bio-aquatic weaponry and experimentation on marine predators for use\
  \ against the enemy.  In 2084, a submarine crashed beneath the facility and it was\
  \ abandoned due to unsafe work conditions.  The facility was shut down and has been\
  \ dormant until now.  A group of unknown rebels have taken over the facility and\
  \ put it in operation again for malicious purposes.  Your mission is to infiltrate\
  \ the facility and eliminate the threat."
