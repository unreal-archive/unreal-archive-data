description: "Revised for KF2.5. This scenario is a recreation of the Liandri robot\
  \ uprising on the mechanical asteroid of LBX-7683 and the subsequent quelling of\
  \ this rebellion by human forces. LBX-7683 was an outpost for research and development\
  \ of the next generation of Liandri robots. Liandri's best scientists were able\
  \ to introduce increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence into the machines\
  \ that they designed. Eventually, they rebelled against the humans and took the\
  \ asteroid as their own, brutally disposing of their creators and mining the rich\
  \ materials embedded within the rock for their own gain. Liandri's commanders devised\
  \ a plan to strike directly at the production facility manufacturing the robots.\
  \ During an all-out assault on the world, a small team was inserted with the sole\
  \ goal of destroying the AI generators, thereby destroying the ability of the machines\
  \ to reproduce themselves and ending this uprising."
