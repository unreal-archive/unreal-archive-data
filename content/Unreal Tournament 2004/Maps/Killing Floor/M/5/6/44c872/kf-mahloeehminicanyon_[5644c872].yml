description: "You were sent on a wild goose chase by Horzine. The pilot of the choppa\
  \ was inebriated and dropped you off at a deserted desert. All there is in that\
  \ place are palm trees, an abandoned building and a few weapons and ammos. It is\
  \ up to you and your team to survive until the pilot sobers up and come back for\
  \ your arses!"
