description: "This scenario is a recreation of the recovery of the Nexus prototype\
  \ missiles by the NEG military, after they were stolen by the Hellions. NEG forces\
  \ pinpointed the location of the cache due to a hidden homing device on these devastating\
  \ weapons of mass destruction. The exact location of the missiles could only be\
  \ pinpointed during the short period when they were being transferred from one location\
  \ to another above ground on Taron, and the military had no choice but to strike\
  \ at this time."
