description: "MeatBowl 2003!  Homefield for the MeatHeads, this arena was previously\
  \ owned by Team Nightmare, and used as their practice field.  After a Meteor shower\
  \ wiped out Team Nightmare, and damaged the field, the MeatHead franchise purchased\
  \ the field and adopted as their homefield.  Ignoring some obvious damage to the\
  \ field, and utilizing a few stray asteroids for broadcast and spectating, the MeatHeads\
  \ hope to use Team Nightmares misfortune to their advantage.  Make your hunger retreat,\
  \ Eat Sweet Meat!!!"
