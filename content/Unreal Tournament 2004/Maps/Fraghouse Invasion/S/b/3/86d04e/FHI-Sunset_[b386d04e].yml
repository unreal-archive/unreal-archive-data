description: "This map is set in a calm valley during a sandstorm, in the evening.\
  \ You and your fellow marines were forced to stop here during your trek across the\
  \ desert. When your equipment alerted you of oncoming Skaarj forces, you were forced\
  \ to modify an ancient ruined castle and set up base here. Good luck."
