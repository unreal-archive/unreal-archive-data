description: "A thousand years after the third world war, the nuclear winter continued\
  \ to snow its judgement onto mankind for his grievous sins.  Most of the earth's\
  \ continents were destroyed and fell into the seas.  The chunks of land that remained\
  \ suffered a harsh frozen climate, barely able to sustain humans.  The few survivors\
  \ of the war battled over what land remained.  Welcome to the new continent of Arctika..."
