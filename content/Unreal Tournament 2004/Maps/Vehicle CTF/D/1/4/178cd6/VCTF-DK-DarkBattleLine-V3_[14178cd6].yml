description: "The Skaarj Forces invaded Earth and then destroyed NewYorkCity. Many\
  \ chunks of New York City were blown out of the Earth's atmosphere and caught by\
  \ the Moon's orbit. The Earth's Forces used the chunks of land as hiding places.\
  \ The Skaarj Forces have been searching for Earth Forces hiding in the many of the\
  \ chunks of land blown out of the Earth's hemisphere. The Skaarj Forces have tooken\
  \ over most of the chunks of land. The Earth's Forces have planned to meet the Skaarj\
  \ Forces on two chunks with a bridge in the middle. It's up to Earth to win or else\
  \ they will suffer a great loss."
