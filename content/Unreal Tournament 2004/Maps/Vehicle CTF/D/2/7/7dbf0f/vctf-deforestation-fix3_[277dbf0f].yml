description: "The increasing need for raw materials, and the greed of men, led Liandry\
  \ Corporation to start the deforestation of a primeval forest on Na Pali, with disastrous\
  \ consequences for the environment. One day, for unknown reasons, workers employed\
  \ in this sector of the forest suddenly fled, abandoning their equipment in their\
  \ haste. Rumours of an ancient Nali curse were told, but the executives were not\
  \ impressed, nor scared, and decided to let this sector of the forest be adapted\
  \ for the Tournament instead. Many are still afraid of this alleged curse, but as\
  \ the combat intensifies, it will be the last of your worries."
