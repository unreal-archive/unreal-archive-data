description: "This heavily defended fort was constructed by military forces in preparation\
  \ for war. Machines of destruction were created here, as huge generators provided\
  \ power for the factories and defence systems. When the war finally came, this secret\
  \ installation was instrumental in deciding the outcome of the battle."
