description: "The business of terraforming even a small moon like this one is a family\
  \ affair; it literally takes generations before a profit can be seen on the investment.\
  \  To pass the time, we built our own Tournament arena tucked in the crags of one\
  \ of our tallest mountains.  We've had to improvise, putting together this arena\
  \ with what we had on hand and adding a little of our own handywork as well.  Tell\
  \ your friends about our little corner of the universe.  Welcome to VCTF-TerrorForma."
