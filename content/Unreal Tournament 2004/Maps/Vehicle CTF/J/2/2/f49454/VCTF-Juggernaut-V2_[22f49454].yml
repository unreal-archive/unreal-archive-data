description: "The Tournament was transporting several vehicles between planets when\
  \ a tournament sponser had the idea of using the large transport ship as a battle\
  \ area.  The simple design of the ship  made a straight run of the flag most dangerous\
  \ and  one of the crew  said that only juggernauts could make  a run from end to\
  \ end."
