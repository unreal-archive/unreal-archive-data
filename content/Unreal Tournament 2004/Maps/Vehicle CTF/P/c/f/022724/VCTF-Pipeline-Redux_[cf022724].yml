description: "During the second water war on Hell's Gate IV, your forces have pulled\
  \ up a heavily fortified commando point near one of the major wells which feeds\
  \ the planet's capital pipeline. Control over this region would ensure a sufficient\
  \ quantity of fresh water for your people that would last for many years, while\
  \ at the same time effectively cutting most other factions from the supply line.\
  \ Unfortunately, the Skaarj have once again foreseen your plans, and if it wasn't\
  \ for the vicious sandstorm scourging the dry plains, you could almost see the Skaarj\
  \ preparing for an open assault on your base..."
