description: "Two teams, two ships, one valley...||Vehicle CTF version by GreatEmerald||Two\
  \ scout ships - Skaarj and NEG - had crashed on Na Pali because of the gravitational\
  \ force none of them knew of. They had to steal the enemy ship's engine cores to\
  \ power their own ship and ruin the plans of the enemies. This year the Liandri\
  \ Corporation decided to recreate this battle in a Vehicle Capture The Flag environment."
