description: "After the skaarj invaded the Nali Castle, some of the most influential\
  \ people from the ruling lineage felt the need to relocate to a safer place. They\
  \ built a fortress above the reservoir of a lake, hidden between high mountains,\
  \ and kept it in a state of levitation thanks to an unknown magnetic field. With\
  \ the passage of time, the strenght of the magnetic field decreased and gradually\
  \ the structure began to collapse, with parts falling down into the lake. Every\
  \ now and then, another section of the structure gives way and collapses into the\
  \ lake below and thus the fortress is reduced in size year by year. But don't worry\
  \ about it though; with the life expectancy of combatants in the Tournament, you\
  \ will have more pressing concerns to worry about."
