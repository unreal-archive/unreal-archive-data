description: "This excellent map now includes vehicles. It is also botpathed for vehicle\
  \ use. You will notice some trees missing; I cut them down so the vehicles could\
  \ get around. You will also notice that some people attempted to get in the restricted\
  \ zone with the vehicles, with nasty results. Anti-vehicle weapons are also added\
  \ for vehicle defense. Enjoy! -The Missilemaster"
