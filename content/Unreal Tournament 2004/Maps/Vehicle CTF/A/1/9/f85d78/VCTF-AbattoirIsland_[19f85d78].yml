description: "The flags are set on the small island known as Abattoir Island.  The\
  \ island was bought for the Tournaments because of its size, shape and the waters\
  \ that surround it.  With mutliple routes around the island you might have a chance\
  \ to get the flag. The waters around the island have a strong enough undertow and\
  \ riptide that anything that goes into the water will not be coming  out.  It is\
  \ rumored that the UDOGZ clan has re-surfaced on the island...."
