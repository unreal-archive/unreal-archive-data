description: "A battle takes place in  a snowy field in the outskirts of Rome. Nobody\
  \ really knows which city this takes place in, we just see the hidden footage and\
  \ demos that are sent back from the elite forces. Its been rumored that people have\
  \ been ripped up with flak from watching the demos alone. We may never know the\
  \ truth."
