description: "In the aftermath of a plague swept kingdom, there were survivors who\
  \ found themselves exiled from the capital City of Lace due to familial ties with\
  \ its plague victims. With nothing but their clothes on their backs (and sometimes\
  \ not even that), their homes were burnt and livestock slaughtered or stolen wholesale.\
  \ Finding themselves within the ruins of the Valley of Leer, these exiles swore\
  \ vengeance upon those whom which they formerly swore allegiance. The Liandri Corporation,\
  \ siezing every opportunity to export violence and strife to a bloodthirsty audience,\
  \ began dealing arms and armor to willing recipients on both sides of this conflict\
  \ to better promote its gory action. The 'lowtech' establishment of this planet\
  \ having thus died, the war was naturally moved to areas on the world that provided\
  \ more abundant resources with which to supply both armies new equipment. The City\
  \ of Lace and the Valley of Leer has by now so ravaged by the fury of modern technology\
  \ as to render their possession superficial at most by military means, so the Liandri\
  \ Corporation has thoughtfully decided to supply both sides of this territory, dubbed\
  \ the 'August Front' for its regal heritage, with imported mercenaries to promote\
  \ the conflict on this popular rocky battlefield. A Liandri P.R. executive has made\
  \ assurances that these broadcasts will now be withdrawn from the global war and\
  \ contained with this area..."
