description: "This airport once belonged to the Axon Corporation. It was used for\
  \ the covert shipping of sensitive goods and its location was kept a secret. However,\
  \ an incident involving a malfuntioning Nexus missile revealed its location to half\
  \ the system and the Axon Corporation quickly abandoned the site. It was later adapted\
  \ for Tournament use by the Liandri."
