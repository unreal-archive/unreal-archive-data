description: "Stationed at 24,000 feet and veiled behind blinding fog and constant\
  \ snow, Arctic Stronghold provided the perfect place to conduct unsanctioned military\
  \ experiments for use against the Skaarj. Restructured for Onslaught, this arena\
  \ allows several paths to your enemy, and countless paths to death for the foolish\
  \ or unwary."
