description: "They archeologists were impressed when they uncoved these two perfectly\
  \ identical ziggurats. While their origin has not yet been confirmed, legend says\
  \ that they were built by the Nali in honor of Chizra, the God of Water, in the\
  \ hopes that the deity would protect them from a great reptilian threat. And the\
  \ legend will live on, as the Liandri Coporation did not wait for the archeological\
  \ studies to finish, before converting the site for the Tournament."
