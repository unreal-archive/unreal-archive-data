description: "Tonight's entertainment was ment to be somewhere else, but due to a\
  \ terrible accident involving a redeemer and some radioactive waste containers,\
  \ we have to shut down that arena for a long, long time. Fortunately, we were able\
  \ to get a substitute arena quickly, when The Dyson Dam Hydroworks jumped in and\
  \ kindly provided the location for this evenings battlefield.||Enjoy the carnage\
  \ !!||Original level design by Steve Banks for Mobile Forces.||"
