description: "A long time ago this place was full of life. It was a key point of a\
  \ giant trade route and cargo ships guided by the lighthouse would come and leave\
  \ here everyday. Trains full of goods would slowly depart from the stations only\
  \ to come back overloaded with everything you could imagine. Those who lived here\
  \ worked here and the port was providing them with everything they needed.||Things\
  \ have changed since then. New technology meant that the waterfall at the delta\
  \ of this river was no longer an obstacle, so there was no need for anybody to pass\
  \ through this place. The train station was reduced to only transport people who\
  \ now had to find a job outside of the town, the roads were derelict, coming to\
  \ an unusable state with time, and were blocked. The port had now been only used\
  \ to transport heavy cargo from one riverside to another.||More time passed and\
  \ the last of the population abandoned this place. The lighthouse was occupied by\
  \ a captain who refused to leave his hometown. Nobody has ever seen him since then\
  \ but his ship is still in the port, working for the now little needs of the town.\
  \ The automated trains are still stopping by here but the doors never open.||Though\
  \ the town was of little use to anybody, somebody had to keep the railways in tact,\
  \ so a company the name of which is kept secret (but really nobody cares to know)\
  \ bought this place out to run a deadly tournament within its' boundaries. Some\
  \ people ask why all trains on this line have darkened windows and others complain\
  \ about noises coming from the roof when passing through this area but there were\
  \ no accident reports about anybody who happened to get killed by a rocket that\
  \ flew into a window of a train that stopped here, though it might be kept secret.\
  \ Or nobody cares.||Visit rusut.ru and remboserver.com"
