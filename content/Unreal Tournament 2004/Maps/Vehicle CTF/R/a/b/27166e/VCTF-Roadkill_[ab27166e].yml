description: "This station was originally built as a multi-purpose platform to carry\
  \ out both small shuttle launches and weather research, away from the thick, acidic\
  \ smog that hung over the city below. However, as global warming fuelled the atmosphere's\
  \ intensity, the station was deemed unfit for use. Thanks to Liandri, this versatile\
  \ platform now has one single, more macabre purpose to fulfill."
