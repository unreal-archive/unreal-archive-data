description: "Bonus? I don`t need no stinking bonus, just keep that fool Komek outta\
  \ my way! Damn crazy Nali drives like a demon, but he`s more interested in vehicular\
  \ manslaughter than running the flag! And make sure you get Gorge on the roster;\
  \ he`s mean enough to take out the gun turrets and cover our asses. Yeah, yeah,\
  \ I know Prism is jumping for a chance to carry for Blue, but Brock is quicker on\
  \ his feet and can handle the Scorpion like a pro. Okay, so we got a deal? Sure,\
  \ sure, just make sure the stunt vehicles and low gravity generator is ready in\
  \ time for tonight`s bout, got it?"
