description: "Deep, under all the tons of rock and stone, there is a gargantuan cavern.\
  \  How was it formed? Well nobody really knows.  Great crystals illuminate the floor\
  \ of this great cavern, revealing many hills and falls.  A designated area was blasted,\
  \ cut, and moulded to make an ideal arean for the tournament."
