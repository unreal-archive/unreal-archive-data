description: "One of the few power stations left after the Skaarj attack, this dam\
  \ actually produces the energy necessaire for the weapon factories. Liandri noticed\
  \ that it's a nice place for the tournament due to the strong wind which pulls you\
  \ away, and the hoverhang with a strong current which carries you away... But..\
  \ will you stay alive enough to experience how's the weather like? Welcome to the\
  \ DAM!"
