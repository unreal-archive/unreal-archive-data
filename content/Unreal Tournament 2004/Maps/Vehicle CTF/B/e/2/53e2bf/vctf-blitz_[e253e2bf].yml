description: "On the northern edge of the desert, war has broken out. Rival factions\
  \ have dug in and garrisoned the area. Shells rain over the desert, and bullets\
  \ cut through the smoking mounds of no-mans land. Against all the odds, can you\
  \ survive the blitz, command your men and conquer the enemies front line?"
