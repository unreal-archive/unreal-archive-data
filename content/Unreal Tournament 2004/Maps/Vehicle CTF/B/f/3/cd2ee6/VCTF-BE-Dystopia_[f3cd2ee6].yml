description: "This city used to be a shining metropolis until the cost of industry\
  \ took it's toll.| |Like most citie's it fell to the intense pollution and hazardous\
  \ wastes that where produced by the many paper mill's and gas power plants that\
  \ existed.| |But unlike other citie's this one suffered from extreme amounts of\
  \ pollution causing the sky to go a sickly green color, produce constant lightning,\
  \ caustic rain, and allow very little oxygen, and on top of that there where fights\
  \ between the many companies that existed within the city.| |Not long ago the city\
  \ was plunged into war when the fueds between the two biggest companies turned into\
  \ war..| |In the end there was nothing left but a sickly green wasteland with a\
  \ scorched sky.| |Just perfect for Liandri...| |This map was named by Adam-MiricleMatter-Harris"
