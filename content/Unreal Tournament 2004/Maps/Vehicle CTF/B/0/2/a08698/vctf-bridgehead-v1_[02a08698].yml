description: "Many centuries in the past, the king Taurus XIII created a unholy place\
  \ of death. This place was designed for his old and deadly battles. However, after\
  \ many centuries in the future, the place has been finally found. The entire area\
  \ is the same like in the past, but today there are no normal warriors involved,\
  \ in their battles. Today, Liandri changed the place and now it is just another\
  \ place of them, but the the spirit of Taurus is still in this area and is watching\
  \ at the new warriors."
