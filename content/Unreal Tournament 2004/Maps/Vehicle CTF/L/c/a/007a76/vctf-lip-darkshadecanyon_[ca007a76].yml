description: "Filled with mountains that hide this canyon, and the trees that dont\
  \ allow us to see the moon's light, this place was a perfect area for tournament\
  \ matches, the Liandri had the idea to turn it into a VCTF arena, by using the two\
  \ canyons as the team's bases, but will you survive between these lost bullets coming\
  \ from the trees?And principaly survive trying to camp at your base, while just\
  \ have health outside, between the trees?"
