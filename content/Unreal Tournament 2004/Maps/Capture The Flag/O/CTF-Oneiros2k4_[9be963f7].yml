description: "v\x04 Some connections are made to be discovered, while others should\
  \ remain unseen. Some lands are best never spoken, as their hell lies in between.\
  \ The words ring in the mind like a dream with irony not lost.  For Oneiros is simply\
  \ that, the dream city of forgotten souls.  Governed by none but watched by many."
