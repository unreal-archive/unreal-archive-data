description: "T\bThe Oraxin installation was once a sprawling complex used by now\
  \ defunct industrial behemoths for the development, testing, and production of high\
  \ explsoives. The facility is being slowly dismantled, but in the meantime, the\
  \ battle rages on, and more blood stains the already tainted walls where explosives\
  \ were already tested. || this is a rework of my third map, done to increase overall\
  \ quality since I wasn't quite happy with the map, and to fix the notorios HOM in\
  \ the red base. Rocking music is by Zynthetic. Enjoy it! -CyMek"
