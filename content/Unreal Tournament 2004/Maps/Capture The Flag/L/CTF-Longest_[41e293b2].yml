description: "A Halo classic adapted for Unreal Tournament play, Longest turns CTF\
  \ into an all out team war! Plough down the central corridor with brute force, or\
  \ skip along the upper platforms to escape the carnage below. Teamwork is essential\
  \ here, for you won't make it back alive, and someone else will be needed to continue\
  \ the relay. Upper platforms provide goodies and ambush points, but waste vital\
  \ seconds."
