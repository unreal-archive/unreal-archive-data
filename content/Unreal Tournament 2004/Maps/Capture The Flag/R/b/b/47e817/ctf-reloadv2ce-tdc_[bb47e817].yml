description: "{TDC}ReloadV2CE...a more polished version of ReloadV2 brings a few fixes.\
  \ I have made some lighting changes, expanded the hallway height in the lower level\
  \ to allow double jumping, and have improved the bot pathing. Enjoy this new revision\
  \ and look for more maps from {TDC}Clan. Check us out at http://www.outermatrix.com/tdc"
