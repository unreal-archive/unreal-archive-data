description: "L.M.S. 7, once a refueling and distribution center between the mining\
  \ regions west of this valley and all areas east, now is nothing more than a rusting\
  \ monument to a forgotten age. Obsolete and in disrepair, Liandri recently acquired\
  \ the entire compound at a moderately low cost and  is using the central dispatching\
  \ area for large teams in sanctioned competition."
