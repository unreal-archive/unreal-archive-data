description: "A small haven nestled in the mountains. The quiet crash of a waterfall\
  \ mixes with the chirping and rustling of birds in the nearby trees. A small cave\
  \ runs through a nearby mountain, lit by the dim flicker of torches. Nothing taints\
  \ this pure land. Will you be the first to make a mark upon this sanctuary?"
