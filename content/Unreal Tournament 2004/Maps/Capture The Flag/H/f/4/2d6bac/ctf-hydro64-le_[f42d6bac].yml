description: "Hydro-power dams have proven to be a favoured battle place in the tournaments.\
  \  Now here's the ultimate one - a previously undiscovered piece of antiquity, nestled\
  \ in the middle of a beautiful, rolling valley.| |Now revived, no longer is it the\
  \ harmless creator of power... but the perfect CTF killing ground."
