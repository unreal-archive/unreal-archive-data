description: "With the success of the Sky-Line and Plunge arenas the tournament turned\
  \ it's attention to creating a new Capture The Flag area in the same genre. And\
  \ So Vertigo Hazard was born. Perched high above the old world below the rooftops\
  \ are unforgiving. One false move and the camp editor plummets to their doom. To\
  \ facilitate movement a network of jump pads was installed on the old buildings.\
  \ Now it stands as one of the most competitive and dangerous areas on the active\
  \ roster. Close quarters fighters and snipers alike will find it an easy arena to\
  \ frag and be fragged in. Good luck!  Special thanks to BLITZ for his help getting\
  \ the paths working correctly."
