description: "The Classic Blue vs. Red scenario takes place on the new world of Blue\
  \ Sand. Blue sand was once part of Earth, but since the Year 3500, mankind has devastated\
  \ the Earth so much that it began to fall apart. Now, a part of this new world has\
  \ been adopted for the brutal Tournament Games! (Red base is on one side of the\
  \ map, Blue is on other, Center Area is the Outside Area, and there IS a shield\
  \ pack in each base, its hidden in front of some stairs, but i wont say which ones!)"
