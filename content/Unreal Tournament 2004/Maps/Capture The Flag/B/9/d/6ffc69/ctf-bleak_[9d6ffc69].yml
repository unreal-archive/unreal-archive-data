description: "A map I built in under 7 hours to amuse myself. Too bad the lightmaps\
  \ on all the arches have to be at 2 to make them not look like shit, becase it means\
  \ I had to compress the lightmaps to DXT1 to keep the file size somewhat reasonable.\
  \ And DXT1 lightmaps look like somebody shit on a bitmap and called it a lightmap.\
  \ Anyway, have fun."
