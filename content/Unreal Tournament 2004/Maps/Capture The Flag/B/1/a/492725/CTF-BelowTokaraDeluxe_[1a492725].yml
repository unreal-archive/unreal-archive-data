description: "Formerly the Tokara arena drainage system, the waterworks were turned\
  \ into a practice arena for the Tokara Forest competitors.  The forest arena eventually\
  \ became unusable due to constant damage from the tournaments. The practice arena\
  \ fell into disuse and was eventually closed.  After several years, the organizers\
  \ returned to Tokara and decided to officially convert the waterworks to a tournament\
  \ arena"
