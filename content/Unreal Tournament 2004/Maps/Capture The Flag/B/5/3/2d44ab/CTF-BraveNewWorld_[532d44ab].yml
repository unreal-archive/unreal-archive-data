description: "Reproduction is such a tricky issue...  So why leave it to blind fate?\
  \  In modern society, perpetuation of the species is completely controlled.  In\
  \ this autonomous factory, embryos are created, grown, and immunized with utter\
  \ efficiency.  Producing more or less intelligent offspring is simply a matter of\
  \ adjusting variables.  Is there anything technology can't do?  Now open to the\
  \ tournaments, this life-giving compound is the perfect place for humanity's favorite\
  \ blood sport.  Inspired by the novel 'Brave New World' by Aldous Huxley."
