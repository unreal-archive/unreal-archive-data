description: "Once a strong keep in the northern lands on Isen Prime, this keep was\
  \ abandoned for its power to corrupt its inhabitants minds. Every Lord that claimed\
  \ the keep was betrayed by someone in his family and so it got the name Betrayal.\
  \ Centuries went by and Liandri corporation built mining outposts on Isen Prime\
  \ and later the keep was restored and made into a CTF fighting arena."
