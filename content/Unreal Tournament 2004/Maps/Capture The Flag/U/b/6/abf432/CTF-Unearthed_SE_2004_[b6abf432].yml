description: "CTF-Unearthed (Special Edition 2004) is loosely based on the graphic\
  \ novel by Katsuhiro Otomo, The Legend of Mother Sarah: Tunnel Town.  In the novel\
  \ a weapon is used alter the axial tilt of the Earth in order to bury the contaminated\
  \ remnants of a nuclear holocaust.  Subsequent generations - now living in a barren,\
  \ resource-poor world - tunnel into the buried cities in order to reclaim and recycle\
  \ the materials trapped there."
