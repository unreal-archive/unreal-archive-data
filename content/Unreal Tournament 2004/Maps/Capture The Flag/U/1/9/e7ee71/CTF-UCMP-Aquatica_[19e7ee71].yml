description: "The sea, rough and ruthless on the surface, tranquil and serene within.\
  \ The ever turbulent waves are a mere façade for the silence of the deep. Little\
  \ is left of the serenity of the sea nowadays, for human creation has corrupted\
  \ it's waters and rolling hills of sand, rock and coral. Originally built to fuel\
  \ ships of war for their pointless ventures, Aquatica Submarinal Refuel Station\
  \ landmarked human defilement of nature like no other. Closed down due to low budgets,\
  \ but still in near perfect condition, the installation was easily bought up by\
  \ Liandri, turning it into a Tournament venue, with the sole purpose of fueling\
  \ the thirst for bloodsport throughout the galaxy. Now, peace of mind in this eerie\
  \ place can only be obtained by emerging victor over your enemies....."
