description: "Rays of sun gently warm the cold skin of your face, as you look around\
  \ you mesmerized by the chilly air. The sky looks bright and the birds chirp delightfully.\
  \ A moment passes, the reflection of a waving flag in your eyes. Time starts to\
  \ flow again, an enemy is coming your way. Enemy flag carrier is here!"
