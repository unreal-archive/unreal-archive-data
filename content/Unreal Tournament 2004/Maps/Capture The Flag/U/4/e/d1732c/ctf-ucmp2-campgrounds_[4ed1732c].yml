description: "Rays of sun gently warm the cold skin of your face, as you look around you mesmerized by the chilly air. The sky looks bright and the birds chirp delightfully. A moment passes, the reflection of a waving flag in your eyes. Time starts to flow again, an enemy is coming your way. Enemy flag carrier is here!"
