description: "On a planet covered in city, there are bad parts of town, and then there\
  \ are BAD parts of town. Built on the cheap by corporate giants, sector 34 was never\
  \ meant to last long, and the only remaining structures of any value are the com\
  \ towers that still burn bright to the sky. The once booming light industries housed\
  \ there have moved on to more profitable places, and the inescapable rusting ferrocrete\
  \ now houses more crime lords political dissidents than real workers. Crime is not\
  \ just a way of life here, it's a religion. The winners get to leave this place.\
  \ And the losers? Well, you aren't one of *those* people, are you? I sure hope not."
