description: "A temple once used to worship the daughter of Anubis:  Kebechet - Goddess\
  \ of Embalming.  She took many forms, often linking herself with Ma'at, representing\
  \ justice or balance.  She, like her father, was also involved in the judging of\
  \ the dead - fitting irony indeed.  How will you be judged?"
