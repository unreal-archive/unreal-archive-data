  \ the newly built harbor temples of Amoude..where in waits the funeral..barge and\
  \ war ships of King Ihotep...As the priest embalmer's of the great God..Anubis prepare\
  \ his body for entombment.His Son the great warrior prince Imnet...And The dead\
  \ kings brother the  admiral of the mighty egyptian fleet!..who lived under a uneasy\
  \ peace with Prince Imnet....during his brother's rule...Stand in anger.and defiance!.....Each\
