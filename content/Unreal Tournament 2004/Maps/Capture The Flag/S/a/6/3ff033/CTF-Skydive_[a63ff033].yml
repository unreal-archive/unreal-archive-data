description: "Can you lead your team to victory? or trow them thousands of feet down\
  \ to there deaths? Welcome to the skydive arena!, At the top of these skyscrapers\
  \ liandri found an other arena for there championship, there is no way you can simply\
  \ walk to the other base and capture a flag, there is simply to mutch air between\
  \ them. so than you fly!, Liadri funded this arena, and placed state of the art\
  \ gravity deformers to shoot the contestants to there location. Sounds like fun\
  \ doesn't it? lets just see how much fun you think it is when you are shot out of\
  \ your orbit and find your self further.. and further away from the arena, and the\
  \ ground just a bit closer every passing second.Now get your gear, and watch your\
  \ step.,  Enter Skydive!"
