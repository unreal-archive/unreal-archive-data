description: "One pit, two bunkers..... and 10000 headshots.  An overgrown, forgotton\
  \ military training ground, recently rediscovered and reopened by the GOTD clan,\
  \ it is known in the tournament to give some of the rawest army vs army battles.\
  \ Many new features have since been installed such as the ion cannon available from\
  \ 2 towers at each base, as well as an external bunker for mowing down incoming\
  \ enemies. A real fortress, the bunkers offer great protection for defenders, yet\
  \ sliping out with the flag can be achieved without too much notice."
