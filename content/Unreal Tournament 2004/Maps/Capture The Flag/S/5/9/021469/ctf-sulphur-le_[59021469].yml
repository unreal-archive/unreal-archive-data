description: "The Sulphur Station is the refueling depot for the the large Sucupira deposit mining operation, which has only just recently been decommisioned.  Noxious fog, fills the lungs and strains the heart.   The money making enterprise of the Tournament has filled the now empty mine with the ore of slaughtered combatants - all under the silent watch of Sucupira's red moon."
