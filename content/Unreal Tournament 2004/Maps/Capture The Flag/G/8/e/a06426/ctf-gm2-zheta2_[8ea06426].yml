description: "Before aclaimed by public, the cold z-shaped arena for years has been\
  \ abandoned by the heat of close and hard fights. While this break lasted it was\
  \ turned into a greenhouse for the ice people and the comunity. ||Well, it's known\
  \ that if something kills once, it may kill twice, so it was decided to take back\
  \ it's past to delight the public; gardeners have gone, so somebody has to feed\
  \ the plants. ||The cold zheta is back..."
