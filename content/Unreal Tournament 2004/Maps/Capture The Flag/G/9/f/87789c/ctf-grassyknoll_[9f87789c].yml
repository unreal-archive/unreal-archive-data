description: "A warm breeze through the trees brings the stink of hot metal and sulphur,\
  \ and the coppery scent of blood. Somewhere ahead crazed laughter echoes the report\
  \ of a plasma rifle, taunting an unseen enemy. The sizzle of scorched flesh is the\
  \ only answer. There's no magic bullets here, no conspiracy, just a gauntlet of\
  \ enemies to overcome and finally bring the flag home."
