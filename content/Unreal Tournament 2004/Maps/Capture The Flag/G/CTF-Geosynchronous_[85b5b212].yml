description: "[\x05This abandoned weapons restocking station orbiting a desolate,\
  \ barren planet, is the newest addition to the Tournament.  Players are greeted\
  \ by cold corridors and treacherous heights.  The rusty dust in the air chokes their\
  \ lungs.  This is by far one of the cruelest arenas to grace the scene.  One word\
  \ of caution: Watch your step in the middle."
