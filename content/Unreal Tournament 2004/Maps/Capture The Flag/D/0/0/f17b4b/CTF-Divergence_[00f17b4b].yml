description: "According to myth, this structure was sucked into the wormhole over\
  \ a thousand years ago from the orbit of a decaying planet.  Nobody knows its exact\
  \ origins, purpose, or who built it. ||Plant life still thrives here, and apart\
  \ from the occasional asteroid collision, the building remains mostly intact."
