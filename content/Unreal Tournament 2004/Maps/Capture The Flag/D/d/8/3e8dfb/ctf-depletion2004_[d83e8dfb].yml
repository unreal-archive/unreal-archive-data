description: "Nuclear power, it only lasted 100 years but created enough waste for\
  \ us to worry about for a good few millenia, luckily somebody found it all a loving\
  \ home, DG-3. The radiation will induce cell mutation in seconds and the poisonous\
  \ fumes will rot your lungs in minutes, but the tournament corporation thought of\
  \ a use for it. Now get on that dropship!"
