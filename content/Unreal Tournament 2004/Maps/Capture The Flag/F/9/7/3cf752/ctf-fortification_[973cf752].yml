description: "Although the asteroid of XCP-12 is one of the most isolated in the galaxy,\
  \ it is strategically located between two warring planets and is a key control point\
  \ in the solar system. |Both planets built a bunker on the small asteroid.  In these\
  \ bunkers supplies were stored, intelligence was gathered -- and attacks were planned\
  \ and carried out. |100 years after the wars ended, Liandri bought the asteroid\
  \ and renovated the area.  It now serves as a popular Capture the Flag arena."
