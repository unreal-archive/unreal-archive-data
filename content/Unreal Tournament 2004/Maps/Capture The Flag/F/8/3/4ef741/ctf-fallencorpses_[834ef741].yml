description: "Once there was two underground species that fought for control of a\
  \ valley that separated their two sub-terrainian worlds. Due to the loss of life\
  \ and bloodshed that happened during the struggle for this valley, it had earned\
  \ the name \" Valley Of The Fallen Corpses \". Now, long since the extinction of\
  \ these two species, the unsacred land has now been turned into one of the fastest,\
  \ most fierce CTF battlegrounds known to man today."
