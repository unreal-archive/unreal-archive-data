description: "r\aOnce a lush and beautiful land, the fallen moon of A'Triana was home\
  \ to the most beautiful civilization in existance. It is known that sometime in\
  \ the civilizations Second Age, a great disaster overtook the planet and covered\
  \ the once beautiful lands in fire and ash. The once grand temples and landscapes\
  \ are now nothing more than ruins and ash. Due to the rising demand of realistic\
  \ arenas, The Liandri Corporation decided to turn this dangerous moon into the ultimate\
  \ entertainment battlefield."
