description: "Welcome to the Frozen Adamantine Mining Complex: About 10 years ago,\
  \ in the obscure mountains of the Antarctic, a new mineral known as Adamant was\
  \ discovered. It's value was incredible, because of it's impenetrable surface, etc.\
  \ So, they built a mining facility. The mining was so rapid, however, that the area\
