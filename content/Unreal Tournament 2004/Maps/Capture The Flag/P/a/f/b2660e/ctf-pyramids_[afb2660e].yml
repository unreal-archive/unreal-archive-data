description: "The human history joins here, where the old but imposing Egyptian architecture\
  \ has been in the time. Changing topic we are in the desert, where there is not\
  \ shade, no place to hide or to happen inadvertent, only there is place to receive\
  \ shots and to die. Where the heat that overcomes the 45 grades suffocates, death\
  \ will be horrible and maybe slow serious, so if you want to avoid it try to survive\
  \ while you load the flag, or don't go for it one."
