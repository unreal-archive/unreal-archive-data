description: "Paradise - Everyone of us has other associations and imaginations of\
  \ this word. It describes for the most people a place where everything is allright,\
  \ where peace and silence rules, where all problems seems to be forbidden. For others\
  \ it's just the place where all their dreams and wishes come true. Dreams and wishes...that's\
  \ the point, which inspired me for this map. On the one hand my girlfriend Helen,\
  \ on the other hand my life, which got a bit better and more hopefull. Dear Unreal\
  \ Tournament 2004 community, I want to present you CTF-Paradise."
