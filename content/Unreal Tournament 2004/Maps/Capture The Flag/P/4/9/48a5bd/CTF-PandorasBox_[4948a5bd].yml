description: "The Pandora's Box Arena was originally built by the L.A.Z.R. corporation\
  \ as a Laser Tag arena, but after years of poor sales, sold it to Liandri Corporation.\
  \ Liandri converted Pandora's Box into a Capture the Flag arena for the Tournament.\
  \ Due to its quick and stealthy gameplay, Pandora's Box was changed little from\
  \ its original design. Because of its Laser Tag heritage, many players find the\
  \ Shock Rifle to be their weapon of choice in this particular arena."
