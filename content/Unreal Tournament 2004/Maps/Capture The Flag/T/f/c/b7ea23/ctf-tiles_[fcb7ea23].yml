description: "This is a widely feared map. It is a highly unstable arena. You will\
  \ spawn on one of two wooden platforms over a pit of lava, with some tiles leading\
  \ to a brick wall. Run on out, and the bricks will vanish, allowing you to go to\
  \ the other base. Watch out, though--the tiles you are walking on are not safe.\
  \ If a stray shot--or an intentional shot--hits one, it will, like the bricks, vanish\
  \ momentarily. So watch your step, or you will get fried a lot! You will also notice\
  \ an odd object behind each flag. It appears to be just a 1/5 scale model of the\
  \ level--but it is much more than that. It actually changes to match the real arena!\
  \ It shows the players as well as the tiles; teammates are represented by tiny Gorges,\
  \ enemies by tiny Gorge fans. It's only a hologram, so it won't get in your way.\
  \ It is perfect as an early-warning system or just as a way to get an idea for what\
  \ is happening in the chaos. Don't spend too much time staring at it, though..."
