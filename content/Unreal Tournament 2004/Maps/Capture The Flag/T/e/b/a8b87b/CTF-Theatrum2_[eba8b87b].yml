description: "Of catacombs and mourning, Theatrum was built to rest the beautiful\
  \ dead.  Unvisited for a decade's time, the bodies spent beneath had bound their\
  \ hatreds for the distant mortality beyond.  In that very time, while the tomb thundered\
  \ amidst madness, so did a partition of the floor divorce, shown down to lead their\
  \ forgetful descendants within!"
