description: "When the treatment plant  Ardiumus fell on bad times Liandri saw oportunity.\
  \  They figured with all the twist and turns created by the heavy machinery and\
  \ the multi-level decking and pipe works that this plant would be the perfect CTF\
  \ Arena.  Prime routes of attack and escape may not be readily apparent, move quickly\
  \ and learn fast as you try your hardest to win The Tournament at Ardiumus!"
