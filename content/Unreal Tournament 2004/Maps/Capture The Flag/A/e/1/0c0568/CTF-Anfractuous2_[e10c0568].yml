description: "Anfractuous: winding; tortuous; full of twists and turns. This building\
  \ has been heavily modified for use in the Tournament; few traces remain of its\
  \ original purpose. Anfractuous caters to the offensive team, allowing flag carriers\
  \ to easily evade their pursuers - there's little room for defense here - cap or\
  \ die!"
