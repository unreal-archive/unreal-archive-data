description: "In the long gone days even before the Liandri Corporation, during the\
  \ colonial wars between the humans and the nali, the exit of the underground human\
  \ research facility on Alphimus Prime was sealed by an explosion. Trapped, the officers,\
  \ soldiers, workers, and scientists were forced to ration the food. However, when\
  \ the officers and scientist claimed the food for themselves, two factions formed,\
  \ each one trying to take, by any means necessary, the precious rations from the\
  \ other's hostile territory. Nowadays, the stench of blood has not left, and instead\
  \ of nourishment, the competitors seek to steal victory."
