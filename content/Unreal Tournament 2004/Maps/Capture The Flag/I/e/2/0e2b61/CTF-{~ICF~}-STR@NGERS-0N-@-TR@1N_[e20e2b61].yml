description: "What's a life or two, Guy? Some people are better off dead.  This map\
  \ is a rebuild of CTF Metro by Xiphon who built the movers, vehicles, and large\
  \ rooms.  I rebuilt textures, added some rooms, changed the pickups, rearranged\
  \ vehicles, and did alot with the lighting. I don't have a clue as to where i got\
  \ the art as iv'e had it a number of years, but, highest regards on the work."
