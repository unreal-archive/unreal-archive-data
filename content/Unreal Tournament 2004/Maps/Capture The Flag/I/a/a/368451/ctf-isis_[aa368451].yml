description: "Once a great oasis filled with lush vegetation, natural spring water,\
  \ golden statues and one of the greatest temples ever built. However that all came\
  \ to a end when a nearby volcano erupted turning paradise into hell, raging lava\
  \ pools emerged and the oasis was destroyed. Now that the lava has cooled down the\
  \ Anubian council sold if off to the tournaments, hope you don't get burned out\
  \ there"
