description: "When a small exploration detachment from the LMC (Liandri Mining Corp.)\
  \ stumbled upon the ancient druid gathering place identified only as Brean Down\
  \ no one paid much attention. That is until they noticed the oversized chairs and\
  \ table in the main dining hall. Calculations revealed that the former inhabitants\
  \ must have stood a formidable 12 to 14 feet tall. Fortunately for us Liandris interests\
  \ do not lie in archeology so the site was donated to the Leagues for conversion\
  \ to a tournament hall. Though the great halls have stood silent for 1700 years,\
  \ if you listen carefully you can still hear cries from past ages upon the wind."
