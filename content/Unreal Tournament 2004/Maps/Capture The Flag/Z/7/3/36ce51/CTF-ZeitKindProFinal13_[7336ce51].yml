description: "A town with all you need for sniping and face-to-face fragging. Like\
  \ DMZeitkind, this level is mainly for sniping fans, who know what to do with a\
  \ rifle. It has tons of streets, ledges, buildings (yes with rooms), an underground-area\
  \ and lifts to multiple levels. And... well, it looks pretty cool.  Juergen Vierheilig,\
