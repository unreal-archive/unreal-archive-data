description: "||Following the disaster at the Black Mesa Facility, Liandri Corporation\
  \ seized the opportunity to capitalize on the abandoned research. They quickly hired\
  \ most of the surviving science and security staff and relocated them to their Denali\
  \ Pass Research Site. Now a fully functioning weapons development center, Liandri\
  \ uses the location to test their newest weapons in an actual tournament setting.||The\
  \ harsh, bitterly cold, environment stresses to the limit not only the competitors,\
  \ but the weapons as well. If an armament can survive and function here, it will\
  \ likely flourish in most the other arenas.||"
