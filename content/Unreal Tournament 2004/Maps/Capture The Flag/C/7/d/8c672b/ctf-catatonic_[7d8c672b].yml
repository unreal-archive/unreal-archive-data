description: "Catatonic - adj. A description of a system that gives no indication\
  \ that it is still working. This might be because it has crashed without being able\
  \ to give any error message or because it is busy but not designed to give any feedback.||You\
  \ fight to the death in a decript facility once used to assemble small-scale teleportation\
  \ devices, that is now in a state of such disrepair its only remaining useful purpose\
  \ is for destruction. Don't bother looking for signs of life - you won't find any."
