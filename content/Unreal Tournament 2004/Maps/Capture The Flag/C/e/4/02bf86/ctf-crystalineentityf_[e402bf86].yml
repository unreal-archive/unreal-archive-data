description: "On a abandoned  world the largest jade crystal in the known universe\
  \ was found.  To the dismay of the finder it was alive.  The green glow of the Crystal\
  \ causes men to go mad with hate feeding the great beast within.  Once a bargain\
  \ was struck with the entity it became a endless source of energy. It now sits in\
  \ a energy station far from normal men...  Only contestants of the tournament get\
  \ the privilege of feeding the great beast."
