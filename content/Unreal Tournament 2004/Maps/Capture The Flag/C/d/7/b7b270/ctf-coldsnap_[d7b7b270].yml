description: "Welcome to military outpost #6629B! Make yourself comfortable and keep\
  \ warm, it's a cold winter. The power and heat hasn't been working since last week's\
  \ battle, but some of the trucks are still burning, they're plenty warm. Of course,\
  \ it's not like you'll need to worry for long, the Rickover reactor just over the\
  \ horizon is about to breach the containment the emergency crews set up before they\
  \ stranded us here; we'll all be nice and toasty then! What do you mean, evacuation?\
  \ You kidding? || Cold Snap's my entry for the Nalicity Floorplan Challenge, shaped\
  \ like dollar sign. ($) Merry christmas, I hopes ya like the map!"
