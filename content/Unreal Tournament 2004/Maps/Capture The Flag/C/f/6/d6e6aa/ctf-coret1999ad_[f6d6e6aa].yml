description: "Captain's Log - Stardate: 62468||Since the battle of Unreal Tournament\
  \ 2003 had started, many races wanted to become the best.||During the finals, only\
  \ two races proofed to be the best. It was the Humans vs the Artificial Life Form.\
  \ Cause the ALF was still in its own developing stage, the Humans won the finals.||The\
  \ ALF studied their greatest adversaries and asked for a rematch. The Humans kicked\
  \ some ALF ass some time ago and were happy to do it again. Sadly for the ALF, they\
  \ got their asses kicked again by the same group of Humans.||After the ALF knew\
  \ they were no match for these days Humans, they wanted to know why the Human race\
  \ was always anticipating that good during different kind of scenarios. So they\
  \ did a big background check of the Human race.||After some research, they found\
  \ out that the humans skills developed rapidly cause of an old and ancient map called\
  \ Coret Facility. The ALF tried to find that place, but when they did it was all\
  \ messed up cause of all the training that took place since 1999 AD. They trained\
  \ in this map but it didn't take long until they found out that it wasn't the same\
  \ as it was in the older days when the Humans trained there. The ALF could only\
  \ read and learn from the history that was written, but they knew they needed more\
  \ to match up against todays Humans.||So the ALF started working on a plan to get\
  \ the old time map with the old time action. They placed a lot of work into various\
  \ options but only one was the best \"GOING BACK INTO THE PAST\". The ALF secretly\
  \ examined the translocator and managed to upgrade it to a Time Portal.||Now the\
  \ ALF had the ability to travel through time. They gathered up the team and went\
  \ towards the tournaments of 1999 where the great map CTF-Coret was in an un-wrecked\
  \ stage. The ALF trained kick ass hard to get the best, and after some long training\
  \ matches they were. The next step was to go back to their own time period and kick\
  \ some Humans ass.||Cause of all the hard training in the past, they won all tournaments\
  \ in the present, they were No. 1 game after game.||Soon the ALF were bored with\
  \ kicking everybody's asses and wanted to have the same competitive feeling of the\
  \ old matches again. So they knew that the other races needed to gain strength and\
  \ tactics again. They decided to make a public time bridge between the present and\
  \ the past's CTF-Coret map to make the adversaries of today worthy again.||That's\
  \ how the kick ass map CTF-Coret from the old days, got back into the Unreal Tournament\
  \ 2003 maplist known as CTF-Coret1999AD."
