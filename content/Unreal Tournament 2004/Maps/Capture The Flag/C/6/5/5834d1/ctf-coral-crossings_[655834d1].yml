description: "U want land? Fight for it! Supershield replaced medkits from q3wcp16,\
  \ dont be stupid about getting Ddamage. The size of the map and subsequent timing\
  \ requires that all players be vigilant otherwise Flag go BYE BYE.  Reports of enemy\
  \ encampments near your teams forward observer posts have surfaced. As this shipping\
  \ lane is vital to your teams continued success in this theatre you must defend\
  \ it at all costs. Once you have defeated the enemy both spiritually and physically\
  \ Only then can victory be assured. However if you are a Fukin Deezgrace Maybe you\
  \ should go for a swim with the nice sharkies?"
