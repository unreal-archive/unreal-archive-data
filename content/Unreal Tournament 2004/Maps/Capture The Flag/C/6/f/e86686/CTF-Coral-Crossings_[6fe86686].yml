description: "U want land? Fight for it! Supershields, kegs o health, and many weapon\
  \ await your grubby little mitts. The size of the map and subsequent timing requires\
  \ that all players be vigilant otherwise Flag go BYE BYE. Reports of enemy encampments\
  \ near your teams forward observer posts have surfaced. As this shipping lane is\
  \ vital to your teams continued success in this theatre you must defend it at all\
  \ costs. Once you have defeated the enemy both spiritually and physically Only then\
  \ can victory be assured. However if you are a Fukin Deezgrace Maybe you should\
  \ go for a swim with the nice fISHIES?"
