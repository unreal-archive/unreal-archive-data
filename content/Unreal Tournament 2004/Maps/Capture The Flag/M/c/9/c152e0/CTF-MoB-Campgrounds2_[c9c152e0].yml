description: "This is a complete new CTF conversion of epsil0n's deathmatch map Campgrounds.||I\
  \ build this one with all the comments we got from Clanbase Summercup players. This\
  \ time the map is much smaller, so it's a lot faster and therefore funier to play.\
  \ Especially for Insta Gib players. Secondly the players spawn behind their base,\
  \ so there 'll be no-one spawning next to you while getting away with the flag.\
  \ And finally it's easier to defend your flag.||Also playable with bots..."
