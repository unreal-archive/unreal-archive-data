description: "Originally this church belonged to the Grand Lord Simeon, it was a place\
  \ of casual worship under his rule. When the church began to fall into disuse Lord\
  \ Simeon decided to put it to other uses. Coincidently Liandri was also looking\
  \ for a new arena to test their latest time travelling teleporter technology. Lord\
  \ Simeons church was the perfect choice. Liandri immediately begun to lease the\
  \ church as a test arena. The time travelling teleporters were a success, but they\
  \ were too expensive to set up and could not be used practically in other arenas.\
  \ The scheme was not a complete loss though. The arena itself was ranked as one\
  \ of the top ten most innovative arenas ever. With those statistics at hand Liandri\
  \ immediately snatched the arena from Lord Simeon and handed control over to the\
  \ arena designer known as The Iron Knuckle. Now refitted for CTF4 gameplay, the\
  \ church morphs from a 6 contestant test arena into a 16 warrior battlefield for\
  \ the elite."
