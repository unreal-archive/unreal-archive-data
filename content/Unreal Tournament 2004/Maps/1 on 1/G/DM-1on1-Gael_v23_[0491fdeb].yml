description: "Gael v23 is a replica made from scratch, Fischköpfe style. When I first\
  \ saw Gael, I fell in love with it but it wasn't an unconditional love - there were\
  \ changes needed to suit my playing style (or lack of). Thus, I rebuilt this version\
  \ because I wanted to do two things: one, make my own version, and two, learn how\
  \ to use UnrealEd v3.0. This is my first attempt at making something, albeit, not\
  \ original. It is fun to play and it's a nice alternative to the original Gael.\
  \ Enjoy."
