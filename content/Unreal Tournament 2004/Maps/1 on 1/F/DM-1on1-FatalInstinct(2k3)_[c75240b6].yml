description: "Sand and dust hover motionless above the ground. The sun glares down.\
  \ The occasional wind gets caught between these ancient walls, its whining voice\
  \ the only sound to be heard and the Question remains: Whom do you trust, when your\
  \ eye can't pierce the yellow sheet of the desert? Is it what you hear . . . ? Your\
  \ line of sight . . . ? Mortal experience . . . ? The warm trigger of your laser-guided\
  \ Rocket Launcher . . . ?                                                      \
  \  No . . . ?                                                                  \
  \    It is your Instincts then, you have to rely on in order to survive. Your Instinct\
  \ will guide you. Nothing else. Your Fatal Instinct."
