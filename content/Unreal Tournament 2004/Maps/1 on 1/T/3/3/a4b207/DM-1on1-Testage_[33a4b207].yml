description: "The unblinking stars above gaze down at you, mockingly... Probably because\
  \ they are not stars, but the office windows of Liandri executives who earn their\
  \ livings off of you. This location is one of the original Liandri test pits in\
  \ their colossal main facility, and was only spared from destruction and being turned\
  \ into part of a gigantic construction line when one of the newer employees saw\
  \ its potential as a 1 on 1 arena. Be warned, experimental weapons are still sometimes\
  \ tested here!"
