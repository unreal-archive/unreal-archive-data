description: "The unblinking stars above gaze down at you, mockingly... Probably because\
  \ theyre not stars, but the office windows of Lianri executives who earn their livings\
  \ off of you. This location is one of the origional Liandri test pits in their colossal\
  \ main facility, and was only spared from destruction and being turned into part\
  \ of a gigantic construction line when one of the newer employees saw its potential\
  \ as a 1 on 1 arena. Be warned, experimental weapons are still sometimes tested\
  \ here!"
