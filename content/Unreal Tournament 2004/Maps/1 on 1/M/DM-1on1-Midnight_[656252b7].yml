description: "a\x05When you go to sleep tonight, be careful of the things you see.\
  \ Images flash before your eyes, and soon the clarity between dreams and reality\
  \ fades, leaving you scared as you don't know if, or when you can wake up from the\
  \ nightmares that rush through your head. One thing that's guaranteed is if you\
  \ fall asleep here, you're not going to wake up....."
