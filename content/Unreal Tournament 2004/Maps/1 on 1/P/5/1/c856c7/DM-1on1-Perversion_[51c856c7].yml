description: "This facility was created by the Juggernauts to serve a dual purpose\
  \ - the enrichment of nuclear material for use in black-market Redeemer warheads\
  \ and storage of the warhead delivery system. To avoid suspicion, the facility semi-operates\
  \ under the guise of a hydroelectric plant."
