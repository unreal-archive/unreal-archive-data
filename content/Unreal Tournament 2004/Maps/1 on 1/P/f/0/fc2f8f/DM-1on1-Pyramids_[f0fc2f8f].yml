description: "Pyramids was born out of a littleknown time in Liandri history where\
  \ the conglomerate almost went bankrupt. Luckily, one upstart young executive exclaimed\
  \ during a board meeting convened to decide how to make a new Arena on limited funds,\
  \ 'Let's just make a level with a bunch of cheap reinforced cardboard boxes, a few\
  \ ramps, an elevator and a two glass pyramids!' And so Pyramids was born."
