description: "Rumored to be nothing more than a legend is this certain arena. . .\
  \ An arena containing an aura of intimate and intense encounters.  So much blood\
  \ has stained the walls and floors; So too many painful shouts reached the heavens\
  \ above; So many death rattles ignored due to lack of love. . . Yet, before your\
  \ eyes, you witness this legendary arena many call: ''Rivaling Duelists' Paradise.''"
