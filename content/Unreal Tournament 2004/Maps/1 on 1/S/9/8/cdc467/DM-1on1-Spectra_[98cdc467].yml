description: "The Liandri Corporation is the number one provider of tournament armaments;\
  \ the wealthiest and largest corporation in the universe. An organization dedicated\
  \ to pioneering the unimaginable limits of destructive capability. But this was\
  \ not always so, centuries ago it had begun as a sewage management industry- and\
  \ this was one of its first and finest facilities, entitled Spectra after its founder\
  \ and lead engineer. Back then, who would have known that they would have sparked\
  \ the beginning of a project so vast, that they would later wield weapons never\
  \ seen before. Weapons capable of shredding the largest man in the twitch of an\
  \ eye. Capable of breaking the thickest metals and armor at the switch of a trigger,\
  \ and weapons capable of reminding the poor dumbass you're weilding it at just how\
  \ much shit they're in..."
