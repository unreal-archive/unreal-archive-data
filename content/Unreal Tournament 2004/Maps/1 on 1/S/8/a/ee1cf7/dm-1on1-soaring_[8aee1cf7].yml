description: "As a marketable excuse for felling world's last tree, and robbing the\
  \ handful of remaining animals of their last natural habitat, mankind built this\
  \ huge concrete building exhibiting what can only be described as an artificial\
  \ replica of what we used to call 'nature'. This museum now stands as a symbol of\
  \ a time before humanity sacrificed it's once living and breathing world for it's\
  \ own boundless greed and growth."
