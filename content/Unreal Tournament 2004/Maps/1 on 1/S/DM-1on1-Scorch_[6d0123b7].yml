description: "O\vIn this modern age where a whole planet can be destroyed with the\
  \ press of a button, ground wars are quite rare. It's not surprising that one of\
  \ the more recent ones wasn't fought between governments, but between two megacorps:\
  \ Liandri Mining and Izenaki. Both seeking after Purgatory's mineral resources,\
  \ and landing at about the same time, they fought a harsh and hot battle for the\
  \ few patches of actual land on the lava-planet. Scorch Outpost is a remainder of\
  \ this war, built by Liandri as a stronghold to defend a key-position between two\
  \ mountains. Most of it destroyed in Izenaki's last and rather fruitless attack,\
  \ the remaining parts were slightly modified and are now employed by Liandri as\
  \ a dueling arena."
