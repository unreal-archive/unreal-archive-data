description: "Desiring isolation, an artist built his new home on a towering skyscraper\
  \ where he could escape from civilization. On top of his home sat his private museum\
  \ of art, art never to be seen by the public eye till his tragic death. Found next\
  \ to his decaying body, the artists will stated that his museum be turned into a\
  \ 1 on 1 arena for the tournament, his only enjoyment in life next to art. No longer\
  \ the tallest nor grandest skyscraper, it has come to be known as the Tower of Desolation."
