description: "This old nature-museum had seen better times. There were not as many\
  \ visitors as used to be 10 years before. Then, a gas explosion completely knocked\
  \ out its budget, the museum had to be sold, Liandri bought it and it became a Storage\
  \ for tournament items, until the tournaments got bigger and bigger. It became too\
  \ small and was turned into an 1on1-Arena."
