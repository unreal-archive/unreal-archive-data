description: "In 2216 a space tranporter found this part of a wreck. Scientists found\
  \ out it's a piece of a ship that seems to be made for colonizing planets. The subjects\
  \ inside aren't fully developed. It seems that this process has been interrupted\
  \ when the ship split up. The wreck has been given to several research facilities\
  \ now but noone was able to emulate the form of energy which it needs in order to\
  \ function. The LMC bought it and now uses it for their Tournaments."
