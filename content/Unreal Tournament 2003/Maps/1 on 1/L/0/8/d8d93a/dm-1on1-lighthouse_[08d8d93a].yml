description: "}\aOn the island of Rutersen, the lighthouse is under a curse; its light\
  \ not a beacon of hope only fair warning to all of mankind who may pass. For this\
  \ island serves as an isolated prison for the most hardened criminals. So far up\
  \ north the island is constantly bombarded with massive lightning storms, and help\
  \ seeking ships find their deaths here for their possesions, and their meat. A cold\
  \ winter blankets the sea and the prisoners start to turn on each other like rats\
  \ in a flood over dwindeling supplies."
