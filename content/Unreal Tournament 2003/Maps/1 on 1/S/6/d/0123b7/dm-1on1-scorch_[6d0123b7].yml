description: "In this modern age where a whole planet can be destroyed with the press\
  \ of a button, ground wars are quite rare. It's not surprising that one of the more\
  \ recent ones wasn't fought between governments, but between two megacorps: Liandri\
  \ Mining and Izenaki. Both seeking after Purgatory's mineral resources, and landing\
  \ at about the same time, they fought a harsh and hot battle for the few patches\
  \ of actual land on the lava-planet. Scorch Outpost is a remainder of this war,\
  \ built by Liandri as a stronghold to defend a key-position between two mountains.\
  \ Most of it destroyed in Izenaki's last and rather fruitless attack, the remaining\
  \ parts were slightly modified and are now employed by Liandri as a dueling arena."
