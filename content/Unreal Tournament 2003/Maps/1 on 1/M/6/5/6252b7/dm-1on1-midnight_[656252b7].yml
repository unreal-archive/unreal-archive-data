description: "When you go to sleep tonight, be careful of the things you see. Images\
  \ flash before your eyes, and soon the clarity between dreams and reality fades,\
  \ leaving you scared as you don't know if, or when you can wake up from the nightmares\
  \ that rush through your head. One thing that's guaranteed is if you fall asleep\
  \ here, you're not going to wake up....."
