description: "Mount Apollyon: The largest active volcano on the planet of Nafs-Amara,\
  \ located in the M45 star cluster. Its unusual magma, dubbed \"Apollyon's Tear,\"\
  \ is of such great scientific value that research facility NAAT-1 was built inside\
  \ the volcano itself. This facility has been specially designed to sustain regular\
  \ floodings from magmatic activity. Between eruptions, while the scientists are\
  \ on vacation, NAAT-1 rents out their space for tournaments!"
