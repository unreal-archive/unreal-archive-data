description: "A long since abandoned factory,where the sounds of machinery and workers\
  \ were heard in the hallways. All have quieted now. Nothing more than echoes long\
  \ passed away. An old building, given new life or death (depends on your point of\
  \ veiw).This is now another place for the tournement. Keep your wits about you.\
  \ Keep your head low. There is no Health and Safety Commitee here. Only cold, hard\
  \ steel and the sounds of war!"
