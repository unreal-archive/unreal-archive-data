description: "The advisor spake unto the unwashed masses saying, \"Those that follow\
  \ the path know it for what it is, because for each thing there is a place and a\
  \ way, and knowing this leads to understanding that what is, is. This, then, is\
  \ the path to absolution. Or something.\" And verily the masses were still unwashed\
  \ but perhaps a little less grimy.||   So it has been written, so it shall be done||\
