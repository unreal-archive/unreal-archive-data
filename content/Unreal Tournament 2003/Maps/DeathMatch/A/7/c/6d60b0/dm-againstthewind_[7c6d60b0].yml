description: "Another map for 0wnz0r Industries, this giant pyramid (of which only\
  \ the top is visible) would be a sensible deathmatch arena if not for one thing:\
  \ excessive wind. Laugh as your enemies are blown off the edge! Enjoy watching projectiles\
  \ curve entertainingly through the air! Especially good with BioRifle Arena."
