description: "Links between the cultures of the ancient Incans and the Gen'Mokai continue\
  \ to be disputed by most archeaologists, and most regard this notion as a fanciful\
  \ speculation. Especially shunned amongst the academic community are those that\
  \ dare to suggest that there is truth behind the rumour that Liandri corp has held\
  \ position of the legendary \"Temple of the Snake\" for years, and uses it as a\
  \ secret deathmatch location for the entertainment of those of extreme wealth."
