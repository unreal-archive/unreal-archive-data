description: "Before joining the Unreal Tournament 2003, Cleopatra ordered her slaves\
  \ to build a tight and challenging training arena where she could enhance her one\
  \ on one fighting skills.                                                  There\
  \ are rumours going on, saying that lost souls are haunting the place. Every now\
  \ and then at night time it seems as though you can hear whispering cries in the\
  \ wind, longing for a saviour to set them free."
