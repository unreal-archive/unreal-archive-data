description: "Set in a \"Techno-esque alternate rendition of Egypt\", this Smallish\
  \ deathmatch map has much fun to be had by long range snipers and close combat enthusiasts.\
  \ Featuring the music \"Mars - The Bringer of War\" A slight warning though: From\
  \ events that conspired against me this map is not likelly to run anything approaching\
  \ smoothly on a computer that isn't at least 300Mhz faster than the games minimun\
  \ specifications."
