description: "Dear MaryLou,||I'm sorry you had to move out to the city to find work.\
  \ There wasn't much left fer anyone to do 'round here. Miss havin' ya 'round.||As\
  \ ya know, the farm's on its last walkin' legs. It hasn't shed a drop 'round these\
  \ parts in months. My cornfield's all dried up, burnt to a crisp. The only bit of\
  \ water left is in the lil' waterin' hole out back and even that's dryin' up. The\
  \ corn silo's half empty...||I'll need to sell the farm if some miracle doesn't\
  \ happen right soon.||MaryLou, I know you don't condone drinkin', but the only thing\
  \ that's keeping me sane is my 'shine still tucked out in the shed up on the hill.\
  \ And even then, I ain't sure 'cause...||... I swear, damn scarecrow out in the\
  \ field keeps laffin' at me and some flyin' saucer thing blew up my last cow with\
  \ a purple laser-beam.||I gotta go. There's some rough talkin' slackjaws walkin'\
  \ up the path with guns and they don't look right friendly neither. Must prepare\
  \ my 12 and my keeper.||Love,|BillyBob||"
