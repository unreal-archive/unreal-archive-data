description: "There's not all that much difference between splitting an atom and splitting\
  \ open a man's skull. All you need is the right tool for the job and a bit of finesse.\
  \ But leave the atom smashing to the professionals and focus your efforts on crushing\
  \ your opponents instead.||And try not to blow us all off the face of the planet.||-\
  \ Overseer Thale||"
