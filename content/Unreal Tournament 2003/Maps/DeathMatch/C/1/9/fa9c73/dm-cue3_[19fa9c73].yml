description: "World War 4 Saw The End Of Civilization As We Know It, Nuclear Attacks\
  \ On All Major Cities Across The Globe Left The Once Blue Skies Tarnished. The Lack\
  \ Of Direct Sunlight Meant That All Plant Life And Organic Matter Perished From\
  \ The Unsustainable And Unforgiving Modern Earth. Melbourne Australia's Q-Teklabz\
  \ Mine Situated In A Deep Catacomb Was Unaffected By The Violently Changing Planet,\
  \ It Now Serves As A Dwelling For All Who Wish To Live And Fight For It!!"
