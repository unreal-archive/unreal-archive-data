description: "Trapped in an anomalous Lagrange point between a voracious black hole\
  \ and a ruddy red giant, The Rock is not at the top of anyone's list of vacation\
  \ destinations. Twisted space flooded with virtual particles envelopes an abandoned\
  \ asteroid mine where deathmatch teams play lethal games of ultra-low-gravity tag\
  \ in and out of the tunneled monolith. Air control and keeping grounded are both\
  \ prime survival skills, but if you fall, you might get warped back through a wormhole.\
  \ Then again, maybe not..."
