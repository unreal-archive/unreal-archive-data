description: "YFew corners of the galaxy are untouched by Liandri now, and planets\
  \ are purchased every few years for those hungry for untrodden ground. Nebulous\
  \ is one such planet, whose natural design seemed ideal for tournaments. This arena\
  \ is the first of Nebulous, a treat for those who enjoy attacking their enemy from\
  \ above and from generous distances."
