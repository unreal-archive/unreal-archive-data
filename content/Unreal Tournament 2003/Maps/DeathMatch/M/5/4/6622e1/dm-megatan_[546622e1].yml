description: "An old ship, a giant storage complex and a titanic propulsion unit,\
  \ the Megatan was the biggest ship of the whole fleet until the ISV-Kraan was Built.\
  \ The age of the giants ships ended when the Megatan was sold and after the ISV-Kraan\
  \ crashed on Na Pali. The Megatan is now a relic of the Human Empire's Glory."
