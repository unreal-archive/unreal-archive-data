description: "\aIn the midst of the Pacific Ocean, 2000 miles from the nearest landmass\
  \ (Chile to the east and Tahiti to the west) lies the most remote inhabited island\
  \ in the world - Easter Island, or Rapa Nui as the locals call it. Easter Island\
  \ is a stunning landscape of volcanic craters & lava formations, beaches and unique\
  \ archaeological sites. The famous Moai, or stone sculptures, hewn out of rock by\
  \ a now lost civilisation have baffled archaeologists for centuries. Welcome in\
  \ the volcano deadened of Easter Island."
