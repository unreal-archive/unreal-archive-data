description: "In 3846 B.C. an egyptian Pharoah by the name of Ukitar condemed the\
  \ Temple of Eve to be the watch tower of all egypt (the evident reason being that\
  \ the temple was miles above the surface supported by a tower -like structure).\
  \ Although the Temple of Eve was to be his watch tower, he would not be the one\
  \ running it. Ukitar appointed a man named Scrotum to rule a working tribe of people\
  \ to run the place. The temple was named Temple-Of-The-Eve due to the lack of a\
  \ sun near the planet (Vulcania). Every night, or eve, the people of the templedeveloped\
  \ new methods ofwatching over and punishing the people of egypt...................Soon\
  \ the tribe became bitter and started torchering and killing people for no apparent\
  \ reason, and leagues of people rose up against the ruler and his people. The rebelion\
  \ caused the death of all people in the temple, now a tomb to those who died there.\
  \ Ukitar was so furious that he destroyed all but 1 egyptian (his wife)................The\
  \ temple was lost for 5051 yearsuntill it was just located and claimed by the Unreal\
  \ Tournament League. The temple is now used for battle."
