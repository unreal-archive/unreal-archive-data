description: "This the SSR (Super Shock Rifle) version of the REVISION from the map\
  \ DM-BackyardDD2, a remake of the original \"DM-BackyardDD\" made by {SdK}DoctoR\
  \ DeatH. (For more of his maps visit www.utmc.com.)||You and your foes have shrunken\
  \ the size of a midgeot and got stranded in someone's backyard, in the middle of\
  \ the night. The weather reports weren't good, so the rain and thunder have already\
  \ begun.||NOTE: This map has NO low gravity, and is meant to be played without any\
  \ low gravity mutator (like LowGrav), unlike most of the giant maps. If you have\
  \ to, go right ahead, otherwise remember to keep your shieldgun close when you think\
  \ you might risk a fall. It can be a good friend when you need it.|Enjoy!||  --\
