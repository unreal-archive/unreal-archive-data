description: "The original stalwart was left in a state of disrepair for many years\
  \ after the original tournaments ended.                                        \
  \                    Now a group of oldskool players have returned and restored\
  \ it to it's former glory.                                 To continue the carnage\
  \ that was once  witnessed here.                                               \
  \                                           Many Thanks to Alan \"Talisman' Willard\
  \ for the original map...you Rock :)"
