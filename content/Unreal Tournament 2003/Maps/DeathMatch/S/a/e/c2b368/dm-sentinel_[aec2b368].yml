description: "Sentinel 3 - A recently built deep space look-out post that was designed\
  \ to act as an early warning for alien invasion. Only 8 years after being positioned\
  \ close to the galactic rim a brief alarm signal was received before all communication\
  \ was lost. Upon investigation, all personnel had vanished with no sign of struggle.\
  \ The station has therefore been placed off limits to all but the Liandri Federation\
  \ who now use the danger of Avenger as a popular arena for deathmatch competition."
