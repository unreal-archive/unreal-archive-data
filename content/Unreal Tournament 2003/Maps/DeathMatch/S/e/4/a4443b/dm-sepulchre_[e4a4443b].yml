description: "Claustraphobic combat and tons of ammunition and powerups make this\
  \ ancient tomb a brutal playing field. The twisted hallways add suspense as you\
  \ never know if you'll meet a rocket or a barrage of flack as you turn the corner.\
  \ Are you brave enough to jump into the dungeon to get the wildcard or would you\
  \ rather camp on the walkway and rain flak on the noobs? This is truly In-Your-Face\
  \ Deathmatch at it's finest."
