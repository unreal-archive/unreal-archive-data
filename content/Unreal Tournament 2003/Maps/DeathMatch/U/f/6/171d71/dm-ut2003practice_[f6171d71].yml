description: "This level has been created primarily for multi-atmospheric training.\
  \ This map contains a water room, a terrain room, a low gravity room, a dark  room,\
  \ a room with a low ceiling, a fog room, and two different types of balance rooms.\
  \ This level might be best to train on with another person or invasion. I am not\
  \ sure if it would be best to play with bots, you will have to be the judge."
