description: "When the first body parts fell in the holy waters of this sacred cave,\
  \ it became evident that the patroning spirits that had kept it a safe shelter for\
  \ aeons had abandoned it and left for a better place. The world has moved on, and\
  \ corporate execs couldn't care less: The holy refuge makes an excellent backdrop\
  \ for popular firefights."
