description: "This is the TD05-16G nuclear fission reactor which has only recently\
  \ joined the host of tournament locations. This arena provides tense combat due\
  \ to the amount of curved walkways and plenty of 'z' axis action from the catwalks,\
  \ although only blood and gore will be displayed here. Take care, as you will not\
  \ know what is waiting for your soul around that corner."
