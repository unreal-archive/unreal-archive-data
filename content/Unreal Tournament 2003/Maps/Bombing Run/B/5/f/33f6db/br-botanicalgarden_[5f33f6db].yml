description: "The home world of these rare plants was all but destroyed in a great\
  \ meteor storm. During the evacuation of a primitive race inhabiting the land, human\
  \ botanists stumbled upon the strange plants. After a brief inspection, they knew\
  \ they must  take a few with them for further study. After trying many computer\
  \ controlled environments, they quickly realized just how extra sensitive these\
  \ plants were. Intent upon keeping them alive, they had to find just the right planet\
  \ with just the right climate. After a month of searching, they came across a suitable\
  \ planet not so far from earth. Because of this planets high air pressure, the botanists\
  \ were forced to quickly constructed a floating platform to keep the plants high\
  \ up in thinner air. On top this platform they built three towers to house them.\
  \ The odd shape of these towers was not for looks alone, they were specially built\
  \ to filter the air and let in just the right amount of wind from just the right\
  \ directions. Without much funding, the botanists found themselves hard pressed\
  \ to find enough fuel to keep the platforms afloat. As a last gasp, they concluded\
  \ to allow for the new popular sport, Bombing Run, to hold tournaments on the platform,\
  \ if they would pay the fees to keep the place afloat. A deal was quickly struck,\
  \ and this beautiful place soon became one of the most deadly BR Arenas. Watch your\
  \ step."
