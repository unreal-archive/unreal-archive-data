description: "This Sub-Orbital Platform was created  for Advanced Comunications Relay\
  \ and was just somehow placed over an active volcano. Most of the crew were mysteriosly\
  \ pushed off the platform by someone who looked like a Heks(Witch) on a broom! To\
  \ prevent the loss of the platform Liandri put concrete walls to prevent the last\
  \ remaining construction crew from disabling the anti-grav generators in the middle\
  \ section by the solar panels!Somehow the concrete walls were broken but no one\
  \ could be blamed since all the remaining costruction crew were evacuated to the\
  \ orbiting construction ship! Instead of scraping the platform Liandri decided to\
  \ begin the Sub-Orbital Platform Trials on the platform to see if Liandri could\
  \ recoup the money spent on this platform by converting it into an arena for billions\
  \ to watch! Good Luck and watch your step or you'll be Toast!Also watchout the facilities\
  \ let the rain through!"
