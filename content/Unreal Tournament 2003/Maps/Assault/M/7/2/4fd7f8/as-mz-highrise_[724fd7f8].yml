description: "Some time ago, the SkyReach corporation began construction on a massive\
  \ skyscraper and communication tower facility, but ran out of funding soon after\
  \ the project began. The comms tower and maintainence catwalks they did complete\
  \ still stood tall. The Hellions, in need of a way to globally co-ordinate their\
  \ piracy and terrorism efforts, seized the unused comms tower, fortifying it for\
  \ their protection and began using it to broadcast attack plans. Having realized\
  \ that the problem was not small, the NEG dispatched a team of demolitions experts\
  \ to disable the comms tower. Because of the heavy fortifications an air attack\
  \ was impossible so the demolition crew was forced to manoeuvre a modified hellbender,\
  \ loaded with explosives, around the network of maintainence catwalks to destroy\
  \ the power core of the comms tower."
