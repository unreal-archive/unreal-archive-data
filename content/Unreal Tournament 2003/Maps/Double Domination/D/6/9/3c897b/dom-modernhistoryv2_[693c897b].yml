description: "This ancient ruin, built in 2034, was once a great museum of organic\
  \ art, but all that changed when mankind shortly after finally rushed into the slaughtering\
  \ and crushing of most of the known universe... Here, a thousand years later, the\

  \ lights keep the Tournaments alive..."
