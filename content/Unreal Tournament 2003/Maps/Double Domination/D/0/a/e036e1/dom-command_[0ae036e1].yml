description: "Long scrapped by the Liandri Corporation as a viable CTF arena, this\
  \ venue has been given new life by the Double Domination competition.  It has been\
  \ given a facelift and new infrastructure to accomodate Liandri's most successful\
  \ new sport.  The changes have done nothing to remove the brutality of the arena\
  \ however, and only a team with true coordination has a hope of victory."
