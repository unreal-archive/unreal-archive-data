description: "On an asteroid near the Phobos station a strange crystalline object\
  \ has impacted. Scientists setup bases to study the object and quickly discovered\
  \ it released breathable air when bombarded with high energy plasma beams. Once\
  \ they had left the automated bases empty, producing an atmosphere for the asteroid,\
  \ the tournaments were invited to fund further study...|| ||..if there's anything\
  \ left.||"
