description: "The CassandraCrossing was once part of the HighLand railway built in\
  \ the early 20th century. For 200 years the site was preserved for it's natural\
  \ beauty. The crossing and it's surrounding landscape was to be sold for a new spaceport\
  \ development and after many complaints at the impending destruction of the crossing,\
  \ the land was sold to the Liandri Corporation for use in the Tournament and to\
  \ ensure it's survival."
