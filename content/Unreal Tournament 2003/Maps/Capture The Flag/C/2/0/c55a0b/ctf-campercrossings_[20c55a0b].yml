description: "Long ago, the Vadrigar created this technologic wonder.  It was a machine\
  \ that was designed to toss the arena fighters in the air at high speeds to feed\
  \ the needs of an interesting combat to watch.  Some time later after the Vadrigar\
  \ grew tired of watching this arena, the Liandri Corporation took this facility\
  \ over for it's own tournament needs and they saw it was good."
