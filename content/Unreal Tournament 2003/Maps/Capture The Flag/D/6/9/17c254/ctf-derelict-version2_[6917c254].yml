description: "Rumors have been circulating for years now as to the fate of this desolate\
  \ space-station's crew.  This data-mining station was placed deep into a little\
  \ known section of the cosmos, a section many believed to be cursed.  At first all\
  \ was well, but slowly, communications with this outpost became more sporadic, until\
  \ suddenly they ceased.  A battleship was sent to investigate, and upon arrival\
  \ they found that the station's crew had completly vanished.  Stranger still, the\
  \ rations and life-support of the station were completely full, as if it never had\
  \ a crew to begin with."
