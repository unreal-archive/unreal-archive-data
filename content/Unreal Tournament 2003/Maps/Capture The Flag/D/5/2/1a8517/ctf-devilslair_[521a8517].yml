description: "Devil's Lair is a place created by pure evil so he may endure the pleasure\
  \ of Unreal Tournament. Lucifer isn't just all work and no play. He designed this\
  \ \"Hell\" for enjoyment, sportsmanship, torture, and a chance to gain some souls.\
  \ The Lair consists of titanium bar windows electrified for your pleasure (or pain).\
  \ Make sure you keep away from things that get hot... heh heh! You might find yourself\
  \ smokin'! To make things more... interesting, Satan took the liberty of installing\
  \ a nuker but with limited access. (I think he wants you to figure that out.) But\
  \ it will take \"teamwork\" to really raise some hell. The trofts are filled with\
  \ flesh,bone, and \"lost\" souls of warriors defeated in Satan's Lair."
