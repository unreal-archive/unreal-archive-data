description: "This abandoned weapons restocking station orbiting a desolate, barren\
  \ planet, is the newest addition to the Tournament.  Players are greeted by cold\
  \ corridors and treacherous heights.  The rusty dust in the air chokes their lungs.\
  \  This is by far one of the cruelest arenas to grace the scene.  One word of caution:\
  \ Watch your step in the middle."
