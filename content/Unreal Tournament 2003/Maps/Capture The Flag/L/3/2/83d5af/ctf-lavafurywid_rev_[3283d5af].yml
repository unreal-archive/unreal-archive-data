description: "Welcome back to the volcanic planet Gohgoran. The LavaFury arena began\
  \ as part of a project that required a large underground excavation. Some of the\
  \ area had been carved out of the lava rock when a powerful earthquake shook the\
  \ cavern partially filling it with hot magma. Many years later it has been revamped\
  \ to make it suitable to host the great tournament. The hard areas carved out by\
  \ engineers stand out from the existing organic lava structures, contrasting and\
  \ creating an unreal environment for the some of the fastest and most brutal CTF\
  \ known to mankind. Beads of sweat run down your face and drip off. The noxious\
  \ stench of sulphur invades your lungs. The sweltering heat is almost unbearable.\
  \ You are surround by molten lava, one of the most destructive forces in nature.\
  \ And that is only the arena. The real threat is starting at the far end and facing\
  \ the same inhospitable environment you are. No doubt this is going to be one hell\
  \ of a match."
