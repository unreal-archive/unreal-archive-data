description: "CTF-Unearthed is loosely based on the graphic novel by Katsuhiro Otomo\
  \ called The Legend of Mother Sarah: Tunnel Town.  In the novel a weapon is used\
  \ alter the axial tilt of the Earth in order to bury the contaminated remnants of\
  \ a nuclear holocaust.  Subsequent generations - now living in a barren, resource-poor\
  \ world - tunnel into the buried cities in order to reclaim and recycle the materials\
  \ trapped there."
