description: "CTF-Unearthed (Special Edition) is loosely based on the graphic novel\
  \ by Katsuhiro Otomo, The Legend of Mother Sarah: Tunnel Town.  In the novel a weapon\
  \ is used alter the axial tilt of the Earth in order to bury the contaminated remnants\
  \ of a nuclear holocaust.  Subsequent generations - now living in a barren, resource-poor\
  \ world - tunnel into the buried cities in order to reclaim and recycle the materials\
  \ trapped there."
