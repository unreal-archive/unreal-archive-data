description: "The old sewer systems of Liandri have become a scrimmage area for rogue\
  \ squads to battle for position 1. Liandri had begun sealing off the tunnels some\
  \ months ago but the clans took over and staked claim for this battle arena. They\
  \ defend it with their very lives... Just another contribution from {TDC}Clan. http://www.outermatrix.com/tdc"
