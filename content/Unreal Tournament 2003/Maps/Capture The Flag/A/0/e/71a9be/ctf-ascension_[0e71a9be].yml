description: "This recent addition to the Tournament's roster of arenas is located\
  \ in the star cluster of Osiris, above the wastelands of Anubis Prime. The Temple\
  \ of Ascension was discovered in 2403, during the expansion period of the Liandri\
  \ Mining Corporation. Due its precarious nature and a string of mysterious accidents,\
  \ the LMC pulled the plug on further research funding and the temple was turned\
  \ over to the UT rules board for use as a tournament arena."
