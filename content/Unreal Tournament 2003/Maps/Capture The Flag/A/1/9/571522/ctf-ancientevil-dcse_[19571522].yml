description: "The gigantic forcefield that surrounds this enormous arena was not designed\
  \ to keep the Tournament's many fans out...Rather it was built by Liandri to keep\
  \ the ancient evil trapped inside.||The entire area was raised by Liandri Mining's\
  \ engineering staff and placed high above the planet's surface on two of the column-like\
  \ micro-moons that float in the atmosphere. It is theorized that the source of the\
  \ terrible evil emanates from the poisonous waters in the lower pit.||Enter here\
  \ at your own peril.||You have been warned!"
