description: "The Arena was built by popular demand for a stadium in which fans could\
  \ watch a live tournament in person, rather than on a net broadcast. The size and\
  \ safety restrictions of such a setup are guaranteed to produce an interesting game.||Just\
  \ remember to keep your head when the crowd starts screaming for the other team.||"
