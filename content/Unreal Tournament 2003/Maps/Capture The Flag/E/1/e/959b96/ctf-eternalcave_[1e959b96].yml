description: "Once and still is one of the most favorite capture the flag arenas to\
  \ fans of the Liandri tournament. Today is it's 5th Aneversary of it's opening,\
  \ but the 5th anaversary was a disastar becuase fans disliked the way Liandri has\
  \ cleand the place and left without any further notice. Linadri decided to fix up\
  \ the arena and put some real money into and make it look not only as good as new\
  \ but better than it looked for the grand opening. Bridges are now metal, pillars\
  \ are now practically indestructable and walls have a seriously good looking paint\
  \ job. Enjoy the new and re-created arena :)"
