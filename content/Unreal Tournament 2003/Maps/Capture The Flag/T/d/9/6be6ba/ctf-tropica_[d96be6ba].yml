description: "Universal Sailing Force memo:  The tiny island of Tropica has become\

  \ So far we have only had to bury 2 men, I hope they are the last. In the distance\
  \ I can see man eating sharks circling the island. I think they are waiting for\
  \ us to make a wrong move. Though there is always the hope of being rescued..."
