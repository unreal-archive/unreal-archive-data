description: "Last time the tournament came to Tharax it was held in the hydroponics\
  \ plant. This time it is being hosted on the gigantic pump station. The emense size\
  \ of the station made it perfect for the new tournament. The multi level complex\
  \ provides ample opportunity for both ambush and cover, as well as plenty of sniping.\
  \ Choose your route carefully or you may end up face to face with most of the opposing\
  \ team."
