description: "UNIVERSAL SAILING FORCE MEMO:             Captains Log:- Not the best\
  \ of weeks for our crew aboard USF Leakworthy. First we hit rocks in thick fog off\
  \ the deserted island of `Tropica`, We eventually reach the shore, soaked, hungry\
  \ but glad to be alive. After sleeping I hit upon an idea to get us home, but it\
  \ is then I discover that in my absence the remains of the ship have been hacked\
  \ apart to make `CTF` platforms, the sails ripped up to make `flag` like relics,\
  \ and most of the cooling shade supplied by the beautiful palm trees, lost, through\
  \ someones overzealous axe work. Not ones to face bad luck with heavy hearts, we\
  \ resolve to make the best of our final days, living in peace on this quiet Island\
  \ in the middle of nowhere... or at least we would have, had the two strongest swimmers\
  \ choosen to rescue the food supplies instead of selected items of the ships deadliest\
  \ weaponary."
