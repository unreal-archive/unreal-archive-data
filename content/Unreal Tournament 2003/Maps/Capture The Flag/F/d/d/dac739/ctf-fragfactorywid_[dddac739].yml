description: "The smell of gun smoke and rancid decay fills the air. This is no new\
  \ arena, it is the Widowmaker FragFactory. Well known for the countless competitors\
  \ it has claimed over the years. The fan that once served to help process the air\
  \ is now a horrific instrument of death. The blood of those who have fallen victim\
  \ to it left in a pool below it. Blood fountains on the sides are a constant reminder\
  \ of what waits for those who are not sure footed. Will you add your carcass to\
  \ the blood pool or rise above the competition to claim victory?"
