description: "yTwo opposing water treatment facilities seperated by plenty of uneven\
  \ ground, supplying more than enough bloodlust for the spectators. There's plenty\
  \ of sniper positions to occupy, plenty of weapons to go hunting with and all the\
  \ action you could ask for, set against the glowing orange hues of a perfect sunset."
