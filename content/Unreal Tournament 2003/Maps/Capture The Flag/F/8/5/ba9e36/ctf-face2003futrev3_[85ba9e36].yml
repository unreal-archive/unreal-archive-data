description: "The seven-year asteroid belt has formed around Earth's upper atmosphere\
  \ once again. Like a swarm of bloated locusts they swirl high above. This has caused\
  \ the Earth Government Council (EGC) to order evacuation of all Earth populants\
  \ to neighboring non-hostile planets and their moons due to the possibility of one\
  \ or more of the asteroids plummeting to the Earth. Therefore, the Tournament Commission\
  \ has hastily moved the Tournament competitors to an uncharted \"island-asteroid\"\
  . It is believed that this floating mass was once an intergalactic meeting ground\
  \ for nomadic religious sects because of the strange monastery-style towers at each\
  \ end. This island-asteroid and its two towers have proven to be a perfect setting\
  \ for Tournament CTF matches. So face your enemy and let the games begin! NOTE:\
