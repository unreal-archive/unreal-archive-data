description: "After the big succes of \"DM-FraGMenT\" NEO inc. decided to broaden\
  \ their horizons and use this proven theme for a CTF-version of this arena. Welcome\
  \ to \"CTF-FraGMenT\"                                                          \
  \     -                                                                        \
  \                                   The DM-version got the comment: \"You can not\
  \ run, you can not hide, so get your skills together for another destructive Tournament\
  \ Fight!!\"  Just find out for yourself if this also affects this arena!"
