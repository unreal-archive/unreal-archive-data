description: "Parallel Worlds is one of the newest in Liandri's inventory of battlefields.||Many\
  \ things are not what they seem in this strange and twisted place. Each of the worlds\
  \ contain hidden secrets that only the adventuresome and the skilled will ever discover.||The\
  \ MP5 and the Benneli Shotgun were made by Ghandi and Raven.||The Colt PeaceMaker\
  \ and the Ammo Boxes were created by Gusher with assistance from Mr. Evil.||The\
  \ Fyrian Cannon and the Personal Ion Cannon were created by Mr. Evil, skinned by\
  \ Gusher, and modelled by NeroTBF.||The Sentinel Guns were created by Mr. Evil and\
  \ Epic Games.||The FireChucker was created by Mr. Evil and modelled and skinned\
  \ by Legionaire Joe.||The port of the UT99 Sniper Rifle is from Spoon.||The Helios\
  \ Rifle was modelled and skinned by Angel Mapper and coded by Mr. Evil.||The Noisy\
  \ Cricket is the creation of Mr. Evil, Gusher, Mike Rusby, and Makeke.||"
