description: "Thirty-nine years after it dissapeared from it's regular run, the tanker\
  \ ship \"Magpye's Nest\" was discovered adrift in space, light years in the wrong\
  \ direction from it's last known position and heading.  No sign of it's crew, nor\
  \ indications of what happened to them, were ever discovered.  The derelict ship\
  \ has since been refurbished as a CTF Arena."
