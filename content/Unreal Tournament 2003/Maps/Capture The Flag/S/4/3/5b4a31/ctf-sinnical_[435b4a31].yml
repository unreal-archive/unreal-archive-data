description: "Sinnical was once a renowned Champion of the Tournament. For unknown\
  \ reasons, he mysteriously stopped showing up for his matches. Eventually a group\
  \ of curious fraggers ventured to his house  in search of him. They never found\
  \ Sinnical, but they came across this arena in the upper levels of the tower he\
  \ called his home. Its mystery has made it a favorite ever since."
