description: "The PlanetEater, AKA BallBurner, of unknown origin, meanders through\
  \ the cosmos capturing and devouring asteroids, as well as smaller planets, using\
  \ them for its fuel. BallBurner was scouted, claimed, and modified by the Liandri\
  \ Corporation in order to host and deploy CTF teams bi-monthly. These matches are\
  \ telecast to Earth and rumor has it that only the winners are returned to Earth.\
  \ The losers, the surviving ones, are left for dead."
