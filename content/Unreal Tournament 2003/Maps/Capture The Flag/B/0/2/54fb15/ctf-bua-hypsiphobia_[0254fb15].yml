description: "During a routine teleporter test, a rift between the worlds was accidentally\
  \ opened. Centered in the middle of a dark planet, a temple stands... ancient and\
  \ terrifying... above a bottomless pit. It is said that the temple was once used\
  \ for sacrifices... dark rituals used to call forth nameless evils. Some say the\
  \ screams of the murdered still can be heard from the darkness below..."
