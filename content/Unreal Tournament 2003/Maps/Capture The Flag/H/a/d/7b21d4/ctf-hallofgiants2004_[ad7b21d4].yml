description: "The Hall Of Giants is now open to the Tournament again after being closed\
  \ for some time for renovation. Only a few relatively minor modifications have been\
  \ made to the structure, which has been widely acclaimed due to its uniqueness over\
  \ other CTF maps. Features of the Hall include its extreme height, its complete\
  \ low-gravity environment, its intense lighting, its peculiar speed tubes, and its\
  \ huge variety of tactical approaches to victory. Its one thing getting the enemy\
  \ flag, its another thing getting it to yours...||Unreal Tournament CTF-Hall of\
  \ Giants creator: Juan Pancho \"XceptOne\" Eekels||A huge thanks goes to the following\
  \ who have helped me significantly in the creation of this map:|Bonehed316, Teddie,\
  \ BesigedB, AngelMapper, Blitz, Tarquin, Hourences, Spiffness, Lenbo, RevBillyG,\
  \ SexMachine, and XceptOne."
