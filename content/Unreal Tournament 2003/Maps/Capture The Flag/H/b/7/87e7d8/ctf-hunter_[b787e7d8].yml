description: "Deep in the canyons of Apharus, a desert planet, lies an outpost for\
  \ worship. A small memory from an ancient civilisation that thrived having been\
  \ shunned by their peers over 3000 years ago. But events beyond their control caused\
  \ their planet to die and they died with it. Only a dry and desolate world was left\
  \ after sand and dust storms raged for over a century, burying the three great cities.\
  \ Now there is chance for life again, if only in the Tournament."
