  \ god of creation. He was a god of the sun, a protector of the dead and protector\
  \ of Ra on the solar barque. This god was an ancient god, popular from early times\
  \ through to the Greco-Roman period who was thought to have created the pharaoh's\
  \ form and soul on his potters wheel. From a local god of the Nile to a deity connected\
  \ with childbirth, Khnum was the 'Father of Fathers and the Mother of Mothers' of\
  \ the pharaoh."
