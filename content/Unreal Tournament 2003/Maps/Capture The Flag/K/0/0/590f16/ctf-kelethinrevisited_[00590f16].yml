description: "Dedicated to 3s and the friendship we once had, and inspired by the\
  \ Everquest city of the same name... There was a point in my life where my time\
  \ was dedicated entirely to the MMORPG Everquest. Despite the flaws in the game\
  \ (the aging engine, bad lag, poor graphics in some areas, run by morons and inconsiderate\
  \ fools, etc.) I found it to be like a second home to me. It was a place of peace\
  \ in some areas - the Elvin city Kelethin one of them - Feliwithe was another. I\
  \ could go to Kelethin and sit and look at the trees - talking to anyone who was\
  \ nice enough to chat with me and I found this world to be so much better than my\
  \ own I devoted as much as I could to it. I still fondly remember many nights, sitting\
  \ in Kelethin and watching the people, and this part of my being will live with\
  \ me forever. In this map I attempt to tear a small peice of myself out so I can\
  \ share it with you - I hope you like it."
