description: "Get ready to be deployed into \"Perpetual Agony\" at the abandoned Arctic\
  \ Alpha-4 Research Lab. Over 50 years ago Shakkari troops over took this place in\
  \ a brutal attack against the Nali-Alliance Team. The outpost has never been the\
  \ same since then and the torment echos its halls of the agony that once took place\
  \ in this small ocean based lab. Now it has been awakened after years to the fearless\
  \ Tournament Contenders where the agony and blood continues. Only ask yourself now\
  \ will it be yours or your opponents agony that will echo the halls for the years\
  \ to come? ....."
