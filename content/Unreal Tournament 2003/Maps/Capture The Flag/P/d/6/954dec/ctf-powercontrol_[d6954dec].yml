description: "After the Surigorn government had abandoned their alternative power\
  \ test facility, the empire quickly moved in. The planet itself served little or\
  \ no use for its surface is almost entirely covered with electrically charged water\
  \ and one small island. Trying to harness the power of lightning proved to be detrimental\
  \ to all who worked this facility, but for a person that has the life span of only\
  \ a few minutes, it does not matter."
