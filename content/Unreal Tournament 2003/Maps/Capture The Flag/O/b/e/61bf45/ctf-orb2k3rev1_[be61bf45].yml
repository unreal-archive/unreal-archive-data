description: "The Orbital Facility was once a premier research station for early 21st\
  \ + 22nd century space technology, in this era, most of the early space crafts and\
  \ their propulsion systems where developed here. With better and quicker space travel\
  \ and new planets within reach, new materials discovered required bases further\
  \ away for research. Finally this became the downfall of the Orbital Station, after\
  \ many years of shutdown the base was converted for use in the Tournament, it's\
  \ once great computers now given the task of creating an artificial gravity around\
  \ the base and transmitting the tournament to far and wide places."
