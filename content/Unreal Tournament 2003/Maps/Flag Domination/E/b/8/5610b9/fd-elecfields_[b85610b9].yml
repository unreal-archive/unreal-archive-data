description: "The static towers of the Marakan flow have proven to be one of the most\
  \ popular venues in the Tournaments since their introduction last season. The true\
  \ nature of the modern gladiator is revealed as participants butcher their way to\
  \ victory. Whether competing in CTF, Bombing Run or Flag Domination competitions,\
  \ players must keep one thing in mind at all times as they do battle in the poisonous\
  \ skies of Purgatory -- It's a long way down."
