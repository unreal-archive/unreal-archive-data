- name: "Ion Painter"
  description: "The Ion Painter seems innocuous enough at first glance, emitting a\
    \ harmless low-power laser beam when the primary firing mode is engaged. Several\
    \ seconds later a multi-gigawatt orbital ion cannon fires on the target, neutralizing\
    \ any combatants in the vicinity.||The Ion Painter is a remote targeting device\
    \ used to orient and fire the VAPOR Ion Cannon. The Ion Painter offers increased\
    \ targeting accuracy via its telescopic sight, easily activated by the secondary\
    \ fire mode of the weapon.|Once the Ion Painter has been used to designate a target\
    \ it is highly recommended that the user put considerable distance between themselves\
    \ and the weapon's area of effect."
