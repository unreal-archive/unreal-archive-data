  description: "The Freeze Ray will freeze enemies in their place momentarely. Freeze\
    \ enemies with either Fire Mode. Primary has a faster fire rate but does not freeze\
    \ the enemy fully. Secondary has a slower fire rate and freezes the enemy fully\
    \ with one blast. Over time the enemies thaw themselves out so keep them frozen\
    \ with the Freeze Ray. Tip: Use Secondary to freeze then keep frozen with Primary."
