description: "The BattleTRANS mutator contains the 'Battle Translocator with Warp\
  \ Drive'. It is a powerful translocator which has a translocator camera so your\
  \ point of view travels along with the translocator pod. It also adds unlimited\
  \ ammo, more range and less fall damage. The way it is controlled is identical to\
  \ the UT3 translocator.  BattleTRANS supports every gametype, but due to it's higher\
  \ speed it works best with wide open Warfare and VCTF maps.  If you have a orb or\
  \ a flag the translocator is automatically replaced with the hoverboard which gets\
  \ a 50% speed boost.  BattleTRANS has been inspired by the UT2004 XxxX Translocator."
