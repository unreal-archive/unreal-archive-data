description: "Mako is a place where your skills will be tested alone or in a team.\
  \ This base is one of a series of facilities owned by Mako Inc. and is considered\
  \ the gateway to recruit participants who have the best skills to become tournaments\
  \ champions. These future champions are then eligible to choose among the other\
  \ larger facilities where the difficulties are much greater. However, the champions\
  \ outside tournaments are entitled to live a luxurious and glorious life! Are you\
  \ a champion?"
