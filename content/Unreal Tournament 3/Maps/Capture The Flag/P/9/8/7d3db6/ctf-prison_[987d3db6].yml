description: "The following is fan fiction  The Axon maximum security prison was immediately\
  \ abandoned during the Necris invasion as the guards were needed to help secure\
  \ the front lines.  This left the gruff abandoned inhabitants to promote their own\
  \ brand of justice to their rival inmates.         Please goto the Epic games forums\
