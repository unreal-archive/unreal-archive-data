description: "The Liandri Corporation's mining division operates in secret facilities\
  \ hidden in remote regions of the world. Their locations have been bribed out of\
  \ world maps through official agreements, though the Liandri had abandoned this\
  \ facility after the mineral resources had all been extracted from the surrounding\
  \ mountains. This isn't the end for it though--as the Liandri would say, no facility\
  \ is a wasted facility."
