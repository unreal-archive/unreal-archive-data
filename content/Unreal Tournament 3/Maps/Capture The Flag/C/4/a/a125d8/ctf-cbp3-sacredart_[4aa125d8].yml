description: "Organizations for the preservation of monumental buildings tend to be\
  \ less than enthused whenever Liandri shows up to try and acquire yet another masterpiece\
  \ that has withstood time. Especially true for the Sacré-Coeur, Liandri appeased\
  \ the local preservation group by recreating the magnificent basilica to fit their\
  \ latest venue, instead of using the already purchased original."
