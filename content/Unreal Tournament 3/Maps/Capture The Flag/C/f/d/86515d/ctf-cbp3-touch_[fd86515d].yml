description: "The tournament walls of this sewer drip in anticipation of the blood-shed\
  \ to come. Little do the inhabitants above know that the gritty, sadistic game of\
  \ death is happening right beneath their feet. To make things even more interesting\
  \ - the \"Sin\" sewer system, as it is called by the locals, has been set up for\
  \ the tournament so that each team can view and even fire into the other team's\
  \ base along side theirs. The Liandri, keen for even more mayhem, have also set\
  \ up a powerful sniper roost right in the center for both teams to fight over. This\
  \ will not be a pretty contest."
