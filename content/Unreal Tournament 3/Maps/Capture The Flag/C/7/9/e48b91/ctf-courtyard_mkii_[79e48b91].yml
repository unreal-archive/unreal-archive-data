description: "By popular demand, Liandri has remodeled this arena after severals complaints\
  \ were lodged by players with the Tournament Committee regarding the difficulty\
  \ of movement within this arena.  Also, players \"camping\" at prime junctions and\
  \ staying within their own bases waiting for enemies that trickled in hurt the arena's\
  \ viewer ratings.  Liandri expects that this remodel will make this arena as popular\
  \ as they had originally hoped."
