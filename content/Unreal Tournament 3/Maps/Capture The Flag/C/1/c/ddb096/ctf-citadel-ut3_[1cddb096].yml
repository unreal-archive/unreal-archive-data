description: "CTF-Citadel was originally authored by James Schmalz and released with\
  \ the retail versions of UT2003 and UT2004. This is my attempt to recreate the map\
  \ using content from UT3. The material used on the flagroom floors was imported\
  \ from the UT2004 version. The portal above the tower has the original UT2004 static\
  \ mesh buried inside it - I cheated a bit as I am still learning how to make my\
  \ own content. Everything else in the map can be found within the retail UT3 packages."
