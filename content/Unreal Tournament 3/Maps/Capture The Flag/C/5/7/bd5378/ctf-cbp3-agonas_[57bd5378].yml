description: "In far off history combat was mostly a ritual of honour and glory. Differences\
  \ of opinion, the way cities were to be governed, what colour drapes the house would\
  \ have - all of it decided in combat. Of course, the honour and glory have mostly\
  \ been wiped out, along with the civilization that deemed it so important, but the\
  \ bloodthirst and some of the arenas meant for display of such gruesome activities\
  \ remain. Oh well, best get busy then!"
