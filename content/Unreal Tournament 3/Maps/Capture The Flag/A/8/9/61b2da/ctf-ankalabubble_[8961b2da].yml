description: "This small powerplant on Ankala's southern continent has been infiltrated\
  \ by enemy troops.  Your team must retake the plant.  You will have to eliminate\
  \ the enemy's ability to respawn by taking their F.L.A.G. three times - this will\
  \ deplete the power supply and allow you to kill them once and for all."
