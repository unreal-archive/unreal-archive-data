description: "A God was once worshiped here, until a dispute arose between the Priests\
  \ which tore the Religion apart.  Two sides of the same Belief, neither \"Pure\"\
  \ in the others eyes. But even a God may not last forever...and leaves a void to\
  \ be filled.  Eons later a new God has supplanted the old one.  A new God known\
  \ as...\"The Tournament\"."
