description: "Once the gleaming jewel of technological research, the twin facilities\
  \ on Scabeithrax played host to exciting new developments in space folding exploration.\
  \ Using techniques gleamed from decades long studies of ancient artefacts and local\
  \ folklore, scientists were to join the two facilities through bending space and\
  \ time itself. The first experiment has proven more or less a success, but at a\
  \ great cost. Despite almost immediate facility shutdown and quarantine, death rippled\
  \ across the surface of the lunar base like an unstoppable tidal wave. Millions\
  \ lay dead before a call for help could be made. It is the nature of men to create\
  \ monsters. It is the nature of monsters to destroy their masters."
