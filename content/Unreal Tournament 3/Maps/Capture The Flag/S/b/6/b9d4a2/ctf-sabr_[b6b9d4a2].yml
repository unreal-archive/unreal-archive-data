description: "This map was originally designed for UCMP5. Sabr is the Islamic virtue\
  \ of \"patience\" or \"endurance\". It is characterized as being one of the two\
  \ parts of faith (the other being shukr). Its practice is endorsed in both the Qur'an\
  \ and the sunnah. Muslims scholars have attempted to classify the concept, and one\
  \ classification divides it in two parts: to actively or passively endure physical\
  \ challenges, and to remain spiritually steadfast."
