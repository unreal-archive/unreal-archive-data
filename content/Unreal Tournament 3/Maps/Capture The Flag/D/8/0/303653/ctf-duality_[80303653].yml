description: "On opposite sides of the electronic frontier lay two nearly identical\
  \ outposts.  One sits outside the climate-controlled, properly terraformed region\
  \ in the barely hospitable wastelands.  The other sits on the outskirts of a forest,\
  \ but is no less deadly in this battleground.  Fight across the electronic frontier\
  \ and defeat your enemy!"
