description: "An old favorite pub map from UT2003/4 I remade from scratch. People\
  \ used to complain about how ugly DarkSide looked, it basically looked like it was\
  \ just carved out of a block of concrete, but after playing a match on it the complainers\
  \ keept voting for it over and over. I gave it a slight facelift from the original,\
  \ but I keept it as simple and true to the original as I could working from memory.\
  \ Created by ILTK aka [acu]Ken. Visit www.ut2k.com for more of my maps. Welcome\
  \ to the DarkSide baby, you'r gonna die!"
