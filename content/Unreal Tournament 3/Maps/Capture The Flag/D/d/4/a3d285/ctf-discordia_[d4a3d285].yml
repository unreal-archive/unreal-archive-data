description: "Far beyond Fedic, held by the Beam of the Bear above the vortex, stands\
  \ Castle Discordia.  Known to cause permanent psychosis under prolonged exposure\
  \ - which can even lead to suicide - this is the last place anyone would want to\
  \ engage in a tournament battle; but since when did Liandri give a damn about their\
  \ contestants?"
