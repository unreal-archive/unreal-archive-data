description: "Designing levels for UT3 has been a trip. Some of the greatest excitement\
  \ and anxiety I've known have been from level design. This level is a successor\
  \ to Vogel, a level I made for HOLP2 in 2008. Many things have changed since then.\
  \ The community is long gone. Thank you, my HOLP colleagues for the chaos of creation,\
  \ and thank you, Unreal community for the innumerable plays and pwns."
