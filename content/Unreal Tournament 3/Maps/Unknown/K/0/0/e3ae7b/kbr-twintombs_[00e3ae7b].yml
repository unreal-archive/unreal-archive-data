description: "The dead tell no tales, so we've come to rely on the live video feeds\
  \ to keep us on top of the latest matches. This elegant recreation of the twin tombs\
  \ of brothers Ramses III and Rudamon has a reputation for speed, brutality, and\
  \ treachery, just like the pharaohs interred within."
