description: "As the stresses of war took its toll on the local economy, this hydro-electrical\
  \ plant looked toward the tournament for a solution to its financial troubles. \
  \ The plant still continues to produce electricity for the local communities along\
  \ the cliffs.  While it's still operational during the day, when the sun starts\
  \ to set, that's when you will be able to partake in the carnage that only the Tournament\
  \ can produce!"
