description: "Always researching for optimum teleportation technologies, the Liandri\
  \ have setup many research stations to improve and optimize their short distance\
  \ teleportation infrastructure. Taking advantage of a recently discovered sleeping\
  \ singularity the Liandri have built a teleportation platform to test the effects\
  \ of teleportation through the quantum fluctuations emitted via the singularity.\
  \ Test subjects need to take care that they are captured by the displacement field\
  \ before they are torn apart by the singularitys gravity well!"
