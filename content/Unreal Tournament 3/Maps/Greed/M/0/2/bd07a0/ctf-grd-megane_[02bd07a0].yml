description: "Following the deconstruction of an office building, the board of directors\
  \ of Mégane city decided to sell the site. The city approved several private companies\
  \ to build a underground housing project. Therefore, countless fights took place\
  \ between the different companies. Following their endless quarrels, it was decided\
  \ by the board to abandon the idea. Since then, time has passed and winter has quietly\
  \ installed itself."
