description: "This volcanic archipelago served once as a gateway in the wars of the\
  \ 21st century. Transformed for tournament use, a series of bridges now connects\
  \ the islands. These bridges, though excellent for ground based vehicles, do not\
  \ provide a direct path for battle. Mantas will be the primary choice of transportation."
