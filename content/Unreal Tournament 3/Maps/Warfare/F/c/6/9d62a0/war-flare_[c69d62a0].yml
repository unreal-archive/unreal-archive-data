description: "As their world became less and less habitable, the colonists reached\
  \ a point where they had no choice but to gut the planet of its last remaining resources\
  \ and construct a new home in space. The gigantic colony now hangs solemnly above\
  \ the planet's husk, while the lights of its abandoned cities fade one by one."
