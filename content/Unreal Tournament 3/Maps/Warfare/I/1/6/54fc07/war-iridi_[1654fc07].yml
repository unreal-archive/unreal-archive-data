description: "In this ancient valley a long lost civilization colonized and built\
  \ temples to their Iridi god who was believed to make the iridi crystals grow of\
  \ which they would harvest.  These crystals were used by their priests in invoke\
  \ visions of the future.  Was it their visions of the use of this valley as a bloody\
  \ battleground that forced them to leave?  Do you dare to tempt the anger of the\
  \ Iridi god?"
