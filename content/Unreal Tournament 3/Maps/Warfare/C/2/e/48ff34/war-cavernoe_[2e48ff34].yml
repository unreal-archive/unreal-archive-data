description: "Long ago in this now abandoned cavern, the Axon forces were building\
  \ a hidden base from which to launch a secret attack against the Necris stronghold\
  \ on the surface of this moon.  Spies amongst the Axon forces informed Karlak the\
  \ Necris leader of their army and he unleashed a terrible weapon that was in secret\
  \ development.  This weapon was sent down to this cavern and when it went off, it\
  \ drove the temperatures down past anything even remotely measurable.  Everything\
  \ in the cavern was flash frozen in an instant, and remains so to this day.  Nevermind\
  \ the ice forming on your uniform and on your weapons, you must find a way to survive\
  \ and continue the battle."
