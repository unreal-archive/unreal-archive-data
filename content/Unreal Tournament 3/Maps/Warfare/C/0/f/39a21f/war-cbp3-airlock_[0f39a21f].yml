description: "Due to recent increase in ion storms, this research facility was handed\
  \ over to the Liandri Corp. for pretty cheap price since it could no longer be used\
  \ for reaserch. Liadri could use the facility however they saw fit, and given the\
  \ abudnance of energy in the facility the best fit was to hook up two power cores\
  \ for game of Warfare. However, Liandri officials soon found out that there is a\
  \ major fault with this facility, the air lock controls are bit flaky, turning on\
  \ and off on their own. So as temporary fix a countdown node has been hooked up\
  \ to the air lock controls to make things interesting. So watch your step, and keep\
  \ alert, if you hear sierns go off and see bright orange lights turn on, that means\
  \ the airlocks are active and blast doors will seal off affected areas till the\
  \ airlock resets back to normal..."
