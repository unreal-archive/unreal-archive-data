description: "'I don't believe this', Othello blurted as he crashed through the mess\
  \ hall door. 'What's going on?' asked Reaper as he polished off the remainder of\
  \ his dehydrated meal. 'Those frikin lizards, they have just gone and built another\
  \ oil-rig!'. 'What? Pesky Krall, where have they built it?'. 'Well, that's the problem\
  \ you see, out of all the places on this water world, they have gone and put it\
  \ right next to ours'. 'Why I outa!' Reaper shakes his fist to the sky in frustration,\
  \ still holding his spork. 'Reaper, it gets worse. Those dumb bots have thought\
  \ it a good idea to build a bridge, Cathode works surprisingly fast actually'. 'That's\
  \ it! Where's Kana? Send her to go get those panzy lizard's Flag as a trophy. But\
  \ remember Othello, she's a noob so don't let her get tempted by camping on the\
  \ ship with the Sniper Rifle.'. 'Ooh, does this mean I'll get a chance to play with\
  \ that Nightshade we captured?'. 'Why would you do that you big girl? Here's the\
  \ keys to the Cicada, and don't get jacked up on those powerups like before, I don't\
  \ want you throwing another Juggernaut whitey like last time'. Reaper loaded up\
  \ at the locker before heading out to the Raptor. Bishop rolled his eyes and muttered\
  \ under his breath 'I suppose I should man the turret, no one ever cares about defense'."
