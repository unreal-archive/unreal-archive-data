description: "A massive tourist attraction, this open chasm is sanctuary to lots of\
  \ wildlife and awesome rock cliffs, however, you are stuck here when a rockslide\
  \ blocked the only entrance in. You were sent in to disable the enemy operations\
  \ in this area but they set you up and you were trapped in. You can escape, but\
  \ the enemy respawners are taking up the energy needed to power your escape pod."
