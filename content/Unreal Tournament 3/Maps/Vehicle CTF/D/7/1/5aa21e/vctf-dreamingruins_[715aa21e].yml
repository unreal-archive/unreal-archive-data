description: "During the Krall invasion, also some beautiful castles suffered from\
  \ the attacks. This one was built centuries ago, and since then, new architecture\
  \ has changed the style of the castle. Now the Krall are attacking. Fortunatly,\
  \ they haven't found the secret room yet, which provides ... well, a secret! Additionally,\
  \ the castle has many sniping positions, that can be very helpful for you. There\
  \ are several tactical weapons placed all over the map, like energy shields and\
  \ powerups. You should take advantage of the Goliath, to control the northern part\
  \ of the castle and thus have an escape route for the flag carrier. In the southern\
  \ part, a stealthbender can be found. But be careful! If you choose to leave the\
  \ castle, there is the chance that you get discovered and blasted by an orbital\
  \ ion cannon..."
