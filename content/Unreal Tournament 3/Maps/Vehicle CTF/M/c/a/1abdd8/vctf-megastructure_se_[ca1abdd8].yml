description: "The Megastructure was the work of Liandri's latest line of colossal\
  \ construction robots, programmed with such an intricate understanding of structural\
  \ engineering that they could build complex structures with the bare minimum of\
  \ instruction. They were designed to work unsupervised for years at a time, which\
  \ meant that when the machines working on the Megastructure malfunctioned, no one\
  \ was there to stop them. The result was miles upon miles of redundant machinery,\
  \ labyrinthine networks of corridors and vast, meaningless chambers. And somewhere,\
  \ deep underground, the robots are still building."
