description: "LMC knew they had found an excellent arena at the very top of a newly\
  \ constructed Galaxyscraper Superstructure. Thanks to the modern miracle of super\
  \ tensile solids, these three buildings reach a staggering 12 miles high at their\
  \ pinnacle. The thin atmosphere and reduced influence of Earth's gravity provide\
  \ an interesting test of the Tournament athlete's ability to adapt and conquer in\
  \ extreme environments."
