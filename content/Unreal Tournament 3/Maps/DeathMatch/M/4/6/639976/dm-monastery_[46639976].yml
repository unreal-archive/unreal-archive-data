description: "An ancient Religious Monastery nestled deep within a thick forest, overlooking\
  \ a massive waterfall.This map was created by Michael Brandsema, aka Xyos212. 95%\
  \ of this map is custom content. Models, textures, and materials were created by\
  \ me. Programs used: XSI, Zbrush, Photoshop, and of course Unreal ed 3. Some textures\
  \ are photos taken by me, but most came from cgtextures.com. My e-mail is xyos212@yahoo.com,\
