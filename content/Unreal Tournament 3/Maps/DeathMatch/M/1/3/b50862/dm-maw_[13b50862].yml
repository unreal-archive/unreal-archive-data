description: "Liandri scientists have confirmed that the dead world of Hathos Moloch\
  \ once teemed with life, giving rise to ocean mammals of tremendous stature compared\
  \ to those on Earth. Now, millions of years later, all that remains of a marine\
  \ paradise and a proud civilisation are rocks, ruins, and sun-dried blood. Made\
  \ by Asura, special thanks go to Stanto and the BeyondUnreal forums."
