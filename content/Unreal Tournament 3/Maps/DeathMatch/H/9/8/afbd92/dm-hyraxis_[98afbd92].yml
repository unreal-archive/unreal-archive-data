description: "Located deep within the core of the Hyraxis Transportation network are\
  \ stations such as H-AXC003. These stations accelerate automated passenger trains\
  \ up to supersonic speeds by means of electromagnetic induction, delivering human\
  \ cargo to their destinations within minutes. This system was initiated by the Liandri\
  \ corporation in order to prevent choking airways due to overload of civilian movement\
  \ during the Tournament. H-AXC003, out of high demand for bloodsport, was converted\
  \ into a tournament arena for violent battles to the death, not because of the high\
  \ drops, but because of the dangers present in an active accelerating station."
