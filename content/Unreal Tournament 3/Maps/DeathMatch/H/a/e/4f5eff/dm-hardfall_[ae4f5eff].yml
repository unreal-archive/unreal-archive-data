description: "Thanks to some seats Liandri acquired on the local antiquities board,\
  \ they were able to gain rights to a historic building in sprawling downtown Akron.\
  \ Its rooftop garden along with adjacent buildings made a perfect opportunity for\
  \ some cross-rooftop jump-pad madness. But if you don't like the idea of flying\
  \ across urban canyons, don't worry. The rooftops have plenty of less precarious\
  \ areas as well."
