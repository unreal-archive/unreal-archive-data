description: "Takk Penitentiary's no escapes record was ruined when a triple lifer,\
  \ only in incarcerated 100 days, decided he'd leave of his own accord!  To this\
  \ day Takk has not recovered from this desaster. Budget cuts forced the staff to\
  \ turn to Liandri Corp for support.  In exchange for funding the cellblock which\
  \ housed the most notorious villians of the sector was converted into an arena for\
  \ the third season of the tournament. Takk is still online so try keep your weaponfire\
  \ INSIDE the Arena folks!"
