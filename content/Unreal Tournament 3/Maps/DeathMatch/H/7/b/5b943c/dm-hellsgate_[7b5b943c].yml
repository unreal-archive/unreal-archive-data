description: "Through me you pass into the city of woe. Through me you pass into eternal\
  \ pain. Through me among the people lost for aye. Justice the founder of my fabric\
  \ mov'd. To rear me was the task of power divine, Supremest wisdom, and primeval\
  \ love. Before me things create were none, save things. Eternal, and eternal I endure.\
  \ ALL HOPE ABANDON YE WHO ENTER HERE."
