description: "Solaris Lost Temple - This old Temple was built in Sun adoration on\
  \ a satelite of the main Star in the Solaris system....Since the Sun has entered\
  \ a cycle of gigantic eruptions the system has been deserted by all kinds of life...\
  \ But now the Liandri are in control of new cooling technologies and have enclosed\
  \ the temple within protective static barriers. Pressurized and cooled with the\
  \ latest nitrogen Freezers, the Liandri now use the place for tournaments...though....the\
  \ star's fusion point is not far....."
