description: "After the necris invaded the city in which Stalwart was located, it\
  \ was considered too dangerous to return. Many months later, the necris have moved\
  \ onto other battles and only DarkWalkers remain to patrol of the city. Liandri\
  \ operatives mounted a successful mission to sneak back into the facility and bring\
  \ it back to the tournament, it is still too dangerous to go outside for long periods\
  \ of time as Darkwalkers patrol the city constantly, avoid contact with them at\
  \ all costs!"
