description: "This crumbling shrine and its surrounding towers are all that remains\
  \ of a city pulled beneath the waves by a tremendous earthquake. The shrine's small\
  \ size and perilous position atop an unstable spire of rock made it ideal for tournament\
  \ duels, and so the area was cleared of rubble and hastily converted into an arena\
  \ before it could fall apart completely."
