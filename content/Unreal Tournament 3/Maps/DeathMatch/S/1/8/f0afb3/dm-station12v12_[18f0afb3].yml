description: "Station 12 is one of many stations owned by the LRC. Situated on the\
  \ top of a huge mountain on Alpha system, the station was established following\
  \ a new discovery during a routine inspection of the soil. In fact, the rocks from\
  \ the top of this mountain as well as is soil are composed of an energy out of the\
  \ ordinary. This energy, spreads out from the rocks, it is a form of clean energy,\
  \ clean enough to power electronic devices as well as certain defence system like\
  \ the ION cannons. Some devices draw their power directly into the soil. This mountain\
  \ is also developing a powerful magnetism enough powerful to have a circular field\
  \ of asteroids. Which is very unusual? Small doses of this energy can be seen at\
  \ some places; they have the effect of repulse any foreign body that comes close\
  \ but are not dangerous. Unfortunately for the LRC, the rock energy combine with\
  \ the high magnetism of this mountain causes the robots workers to malfunction.\
  \ For various reasons, the LRC had to withdraw is workers robots just before the\
  \ commissioning of the station and left the station available for future fighting\
  \ since it is now useless. Final v. 1.2."
