description: "Stoned_Cold's lust for hydro-power led the warrior to build this remote\
  \ facility. Liandri Corp's numerous deep space tournament areas made recycling a\
  \ profitable venture. Stoned seized this opportunity to build Symmetry entirely\
  \ of salvage materials. Cutting cost's even further he incorporated a river canal\
  \ through the building to turn the turbines to generate power. The tournaments will\
  \ never be in the dark here!"
