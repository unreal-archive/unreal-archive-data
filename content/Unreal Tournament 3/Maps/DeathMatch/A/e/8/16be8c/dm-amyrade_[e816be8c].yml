  \ very intelligent and very technologically advanced unknown race. There is no explanation\
  \ why this race got rid of their station? Today, it is used by Liandri who advertise\
  \ deadly tournaments! However, despite the many tournaments, Liandri robots remain\
  \ to this day the ultimate winners. These robots are the pride of Liandri which\
  \ some of their top fighters are displayed on few digital monitors. Are you ready\
  \ to face them?"
