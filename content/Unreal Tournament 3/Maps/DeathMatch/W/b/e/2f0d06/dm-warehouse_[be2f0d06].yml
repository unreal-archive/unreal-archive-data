description: "Abandon long ago, this warehouse was used by Zero Point Corporation,\
  \ one of Liandri's rival companies, as a secret site used to prototype a better\
  \ and more efficient power core meant to out-perform the Liandri's. When Liandri\
  \ discovered their rivals intent they quickly and quietly shut down the operation\
  \ with lethal force. Years later Liandri gained the opportunity to buy the land\
  \ where the abandoned warehouse stood and turned it into a new tournament death\
  \ match arena, the prototype power core still active and pulsing."
