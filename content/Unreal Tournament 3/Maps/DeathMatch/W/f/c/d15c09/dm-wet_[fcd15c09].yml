description: "A long neglected pump in this abandonded undersea research station has\
  \ caused the entire facility to flood, save the habitation units suspended high\
  \ above.  Fortunately the back up pump is still able to occasionally provide about\
  \ 60 seconds of respite before giving way again to the power of the ocean."
