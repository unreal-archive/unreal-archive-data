description: "Once the battleground of the infamous Matrix duel between Neo and Agent\
  \ Smith(s), tournament warriors have since invaded and taken over this hallowed\
  \ court. Even the Oracle hesitates to venture here anymore. When your battle-weary,\
  \ blood-soaked body can no longer endure the pain, visit the train station for a\
  \ much needed Power-Up...but be careful...the Trainman is still angry."
