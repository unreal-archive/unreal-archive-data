description: "After years of wear and tear, the Antalus venue is no longer suitable\
  \ for a tournament event.  A tireless search begun and on the distant planet of\
  \ Kaimogen, a new arena was constructed to resemble the Valley of the Hunters. \
  \ After a few years, the war began and the planet was invaded by the Necris.  They\
  \ converted the arena into a training area to help their soldiers in the war efforts.\
  \  In time it proved to be a futile effort as the Necris lost the war.  The tournament\
  \ has resumed its events and even though the Necris no longer inhabit Kaimogen,\
  \ their presence will be felt for some time."
