description: "A group of scientists were studying certain aspects in the field of\
  \ biology that have to deal with water. They were trying to make water as a new\
  \ fuel source. The first task: Get the water to power the station. After 12 weeks\
  \ of continued success, the government has lost contact with the scientists. They\
  \ were unable to reach them for a good while, until they sent a search group. They\
  \ found the station empty, but the clothes of the scientists were still there, all\
  \ on the floor. To this day, no one knows what has happened to them. Investigators\
  \ believe that they were not just studying a new fuel source, but tampering with\
  \ marine life enhancements. Applying the DNA of sea creatures to certain unidentifiable\
  \ subjects. The case is still unsolved."
