description: "A young couple built this automated complex to extend their mortality\
  \ and their deep love for one another. After twenty years in stasis the man awoke\
  \ to find that only the frail bones of his wife remained. Griefstricken he punished\
  \ himself, re-programming the facilities maintenance droids as his tormentors; fighting\
  \ his own tournament, hoping to seek redemption from his fallen love. The fate of\
  \ the heartbroken man is unknown, yet a dense mist of sorrow and faint screams of\
  \ agony still haunt these rooms..."
