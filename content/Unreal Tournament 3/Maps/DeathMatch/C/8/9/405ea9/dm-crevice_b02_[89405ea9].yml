description: "On the edge of this city was a crevice caused by tectonic activity.\
  \ Over time, the lands separated, creating steep cliffs, and a network of passages\
  \ below the rubble. Outcasts from town were collecting near the crevice, spurning\
  \ city officials to erect a wall that was eventually destroyed. With new force field\
  \ technology available, the city began building a new wall, much larger than before."
