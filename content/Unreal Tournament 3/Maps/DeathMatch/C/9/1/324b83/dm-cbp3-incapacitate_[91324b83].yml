description: "In former times, this place was used for cleaning, filtering, and oxidizing\
  \ polluted water. Those operations ended when a recently-fired employee sabotaged\
  \ one of the pumps. The pressure overwhelmed the main pipes and completely shredded\
  \ the walls and pipes of the complex. Enter at your own risk."
