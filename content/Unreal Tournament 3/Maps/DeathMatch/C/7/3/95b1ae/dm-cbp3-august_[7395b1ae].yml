description: "This month was originally named Sextilis in Latin, because it was the\
  \ sixth month in the ancient Roman calendar, which started in March about 750 BC\
  \ under Romulus. It became the eighth month either when January and February were\
  \ added to the beginning of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700 BC or when\
  \ those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs\
  \ about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). It was renamed in honor of Augustus in\
  \ 8 BC because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating\
  \ in the fall of Alexandria, which fell in this month. Lore claims August originally\
  \ had 29 days in the Roman Republican calendar. Augustus took two days from February\
  \ and gave it to August when Sextilis was renamed in his honor.                \
  \                                                                              \
  \                                                        .                     \
  \                                                                              \
