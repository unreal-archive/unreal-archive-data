description: "This facility was built to collect meteorological data and in fact,\
  \ numerous groundbreaking climate-related theories are based on the data this station\
  \ collected. However, along with public interest financial support slowly dwindled\
  \ away and this place lay forgotten until the Liandri decided to use it as an arena\
  \ in their ever-popular tournament."
