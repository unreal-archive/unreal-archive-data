description: "This ancient mystical temple has been a place to worship peace, throughout\
  \ the ages. The building expanded over time untill the popularity of the Liandri\
  \ tournament, meant there was not much public interest in peace and the facility\
  \ was subsequently acquired by the Liandri Corporation for its more sinister needs.\
  \  Now it is the church of the bloodthirsty and the sound of churchbells, is replaced\
  \ by the music of battle!   ---  Version: Second Edition 1.0  Authour: FragTastic\
  \   Num. Players: 8-16"
