description: "When Liandri colonized Na Pali for the first time they have built seven\
  \ factories, scattered around the planet, for the treatment of Tarydium residual\
  \ and properly conversion into Bio Ges liquid. As time passed only two of these\
  \ factories were upgraded, enlarged and kept into production. This arena is built\
  \ on a wing of one of these five abandoned factories, specifically converted into\
  \ a 1 on 1 arena in order to keep high the mood of the mining colonists on Na Pali."
