description: "Abandoned, all by some bums who sleep overnight, this testing facility,\
  \ deserted after a meltdown at a near by necluar plant. Left to be overcome by nature,\
  \ plants have grown into where they should have never been due to the constant filtered\
  \ water. The area now deemed radiation free has been left unnatended, to the memories\
  \ of those who suffered, and only those brave enough to disturb what once existed\
  \ are sent back to hell. No rest for the wicked here."
