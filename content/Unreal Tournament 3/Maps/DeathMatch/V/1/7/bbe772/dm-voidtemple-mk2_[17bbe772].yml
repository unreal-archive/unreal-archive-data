description: "An ancient temple on a feral world drifting between solar systems. \
  \ It is thought that the glowing crystal in the center powers the temple and protects\
  \ it from damage, more than 60 years of intensive scientific study has yielded no\
  \ answers.  Abandoned when the funding dried up and the planet was abandoned, this\
  \ temple site was simply claimed for the tournament."
