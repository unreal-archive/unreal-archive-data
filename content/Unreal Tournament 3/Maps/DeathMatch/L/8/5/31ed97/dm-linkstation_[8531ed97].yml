description: "With the development of compound power technologies, Liandri was able\
  \ to further its operations to areas previously untouched by traditional mining\
  \ methods.  Remote refueling outposts such as this one, operate without the need\
  \ for any significant maintenance, and allow skeleton-crewed atmosphere harvesters\
  \ to range from one station to the next, refueling as they hit their former maximum\
  \ distances.  A single-weapon tournament bracket was considered but the stations\
  \ are more commonly used as a way to forget about convicts, with the promise of\
  \ a pardon if they can rack up a thousand kills, and convince a passing freighter\
  \ to allow these weary mass murderers on board."
