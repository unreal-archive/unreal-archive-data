description: "The Liandri foothold in sector 38 has been lost.  Unable to keep the\
  \ Krall infestation at bay,  the Liandri have fled the system retreating to a neighbouring\
  \ star sector. With their forward defence post decimated and stripped by the advancing\
  \ Krall hive, the last evidence of their occupation is a sole crumbling orbital\
  \ defence platform stranded amongst the local debris cloud. Scavengers now fight\
  \ over the remaining technology despite constant bombardment from the local asteroid\
  \ population which is slowly rendering the last evidence of the Liandri occupation\
  \ to all but a memory..."
