description: "Various locations on the planet A-Tsi-La. A major port in the 9th sector\
  \ of the Stellar trade route, A-Tsi-La is located in the eastern quad of the Tsa-La-Gi\
  \ sector. In anticipation of the Necris invasion, following nearby Twin Souls's\
  \ invasion, many Ani-Tsa-La-Gi are evacuating the planet. Evac ships can be seen\
  \ frequently. The Liandri corporation felt that the added pressure, coupled with\
  \ abandoned cities, would be the perfect time for a tournament match. Teleporters\
  \ have been set up and many combat areas are thousands of miles away from each other.\
  \ The honorable Samuel Jackson will narrate. Good Luck motherfucker!"
