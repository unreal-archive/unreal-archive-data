description: "Several Years after the Necris invasions: Cities were being rebuilt,\
  \ the rubble had been cleared off the streets.  A populace depressed from years\
  \ of wars on remote  worlds and bombed out cities turned once again to the proud\
  \ sports tradition of the deep space mining colonies: The Unreal Tournaments.  Encouraged\
  \ by the public outcry for the entertainment and competition of old, Liandri made\
  \ a massive show of support by opening one of their own facilities for public Exhibition\
  \ matches.  The area rapidly grew in popularity due to its accomodating size and\
  \ fierce team battles, and became known as one of the greatest tournament arenas\
  \ of all time."
