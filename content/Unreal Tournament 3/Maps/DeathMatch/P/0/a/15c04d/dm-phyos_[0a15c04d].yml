description: "This Krall facility has been left to rust after the Skaarj invasion,\
  \ but now it has been bought by Liandri for the Tournament. Due to its age several\
  \ parts of the structures are very weak, so be careful with your weapons.      \
  \                                    DM-Phyos version 1.00 made by XYZ 8000."
