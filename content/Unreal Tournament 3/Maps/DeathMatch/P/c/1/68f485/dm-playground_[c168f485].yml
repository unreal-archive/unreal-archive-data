description: "As its neglected merry-go-rounds seize up with rust and  untended foliage\
  \ encroaches its borders, this small piece of land on the edge of a now uninhabited\
  \ city longs for the days when it bubbled with the giggles of childish enjoyment.\
  \  The only enjoyment available from its decrepit climbing frames and swings today\
  \ is of a much more violent variety."
