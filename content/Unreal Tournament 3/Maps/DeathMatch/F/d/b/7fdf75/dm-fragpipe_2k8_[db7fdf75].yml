description: "FragPipe was once a QuakeII map back in the day of windows 95. This\
  \ has stood the test of time, and so I have remade it in the image of UT3. To bring\
  \ the fun of this classic Quake II map to both the PC and Console. So enjoy this\
  \ map as much as I have enjoyed making it. Also be sure to stop by www.apophis3d.net\
  \ for my newest maps!"
